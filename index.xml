      <span>Abstract:</span>  Project Management anti-patterns are well-documented in the
software-engineering literature, and studying them allows understanding their
impacts on teams and projects. The video game development industry is known for
its mismanagement practices, and therefore applying this knowledge would help
improving game developers' productivity and well-being. In this paper, we map
project management anti-patterns to anti-patterns reported by game developers
in the gray literature. We read 440 postmortems problems, identified
anti-pattern candidates, and related them with definitions from the
software-engineering literature. We discovered that most anti-pattern
candidates could be mapped to anti-patterns in the software-engineering
literature, except for Feature Creep, Feature Cuts, Working on Multiple
Projects, and Absent or Inadequate Tools. We discussed the impact of the
unmapped candidates on the development process while also drawing a parallel
between video games and traditional software development. Future works include
validating the definitions of the candidates via survey with practitioners and
also considering development anti-patterns.

I thought I&rsquo;d write up some notes.</p><p>Here are some verdicts:</p><ul><li><p>Yes, techies (Dave Dagon and Rodney Joffe) used their legitimate access to DNS data in order to track (&ldquo;spy on&rdquo;?) something they associated with candidate Donald Trump. Data they were given to secure the Internet was instead used for politics.</p></li><li><p>No, they didn&rsquo;t hack anything, they weren&rsquo;t paid by the Democrats or Hillary campaign, they didn&rsquo;t violate any law, or access any other than data than they legitimately had access to.</p></li><li><p>All this was before Trump was elected in 2016 &mdash; they didn&rsquo;t spy on the Trump White House.</p></li><li><p>There&rsquo;s nothere&rsquo;s nothing outrageous here &mdash; if you are hearing outrage from your favorite news site or Twitter pundit, then they are misrepresenting the facts.</p></li></ul><p>The background for this story is described in this New York Times article written by Charlie Savage, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/us/politics/trump-alfa-bank-indictment.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trump Server Mystery Produces Fresh Conflict</a>&rdquo; (from last September). The article identifies those involved. I assume you know this much background.</p><p>The major background points are:</p><ul><li><p>Trump&rsquo;s DoJ appointed John Durham as special counsel to investigate the Mueller investigation &mdash; a counter-investigation if you will. Durham is trying to debunk things like the infamous Steele Dossier.</p></li><li><p>Durham indicted Michael Sussmann, a lawyer working on the fringe of the Hillary campaign, for lying to the FBI.</p></li><li><p>Sussmann was bringing a report from DNS researchers (Rodney Joffe, Dave Dagon, and others) that claimed to find in Internet logs evidence of a secret communications channel between Trump Organization and Alfa Bank &mdash; a big Russian bank tied to Putin.</p></li></ul><p>The new thing is a <strong>recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638/gov.uscourts.dcd.235638.35.0_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">court filing</a></strong> from Durham claiming that one of Sussmann&rsquo;s lawyers has a conflict on interest. Along the way, he revealed something new: these techies had produced a second report about suspicious Russian-made phones following the Trump campaign. A Russian company YotaPhone made an innovative phone with an e-ink display, but was only sold in Europe, and didn&rsquo;t work with US carriers.</p><p>Yet, according to DNS data, one or more of these rare phones were associated with Trump&rsquo;s activities on the campaign trail, showing up at what they claim are suspiciously coincidental times at Spectrum Health (run the Trump allies in the DeVos family), his apartment building, and his office building. Neustar can track all its activities &mdash; only when it attached to a WiFi network that ran DNS queries through Neustar, and only when it was making contact with Yota servers, such as trying to download software updates.</p><p>Charlie Savage at the New York Times has a nice article debunking the right-wing narrative on this, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/politics/durham-sussmann-trump-russia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Court Filing Started a Furor in Right-Wing Outlets, but Their Narrative Is Off Track</a>&rdquo;. Despite being biased, he&rsquo;s got the best access to the people involved.</p><p>The Durham court filing at the heart of this is twisted and misleading. The narratives on right-wing sites are even worse. For example, John Yoo claims in <a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6297560487001#sp=show-clips" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Fox News segment</a> &ldquo;<em>a tech company executive broke into the White House Internet system &mdash; the White House connection to the Internet, and emails, was collecting data&hellip;it seems to me this is a federal crime of hacking</em>&rdquo;. This is something Yoo just made up completely, it wasn&rsquo;t in the court filing, there&rsquo;s no fact to substantiate this.</p><p>On the other hand, Charlie Savage bends things the other way, trying to defend the researchers. This isn&rsquo;t appropriate, either.</p><p>Joffe and Dagon monitor part of the DNS system looking for signs of hacker activity, malware, and phishing campaigns. They only get DNS logs from customers who voluntarily give them that information. The White House (through intermediaries) redirected their DNS queries through Neustar (Joffe&rsquo;s company) servers. Neustar blocks cybersecurity threats &mdash; a useful service to customers like the White House.</p><p>To provide this service, techies at Neustar are constantly sifting through logs of DNS queries sent to them (again, voluntarily by customers). Neustar can&rsquo;t see the contents of any other Internet traffic, like web pages, emails, or Zoom calls. They can only see the DNS lookups, they can only see requests for names and where they came from. Imagine your companies is a Neustar client, and you attempted to visit ExpertSexChange.com. They&rsquo;ll see this fact.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a privacy and security concern, but not necessarily a big one. What these companies can see into your activities is minor compared to the big cybersecurity protections they provide.</p><p>Dave Dagon is a researcher at Georgia Tech, working with other DNS researchers. They got a grant from DARPA to analyze DNS logs to track down hackers. They worked with Neustar and Joffe on the project. </p><p>It&rsquo;s unclear where the logs came from for their first report on Alfa Bank, maybe Neustar, maybe some other source. However, for the second report on YotaPhones, mentioned in the recent court filing, the data definitely came from Neustar.</p><p>Thus, they all had lawful access to the data to mine it for security threats. This includes data from the White House, who voluntarily gave that data to Neustar. Likewise, many other organizations gave their DNS data voluntarily to Neustar, including those associated with Trump. No hacking, like what John Yoo claims, was involved.</p><p>But while Neustar gave researchers permission to use the data for hunting <em>cyberthreats</em>, tracking down <em>hackers</em>, they likely didn&rsquo;t give permission to look for collusion between Trump and the Russians.</p><p>The situation is the same as Trump&rsquo;s first impeachment, the phone call where he tried to coerce the Ukraine leader to pursue a criminal investigation into his political rival&rsquo;s son. Trump claimed that this was part of his legitimate activities as President to fight international crime. But it was clearly an abuse of power pursuing his political goals &mdash; &ldquo;fighting crime&rdquo; was just an excuse.</p><p>Here, DNS researchers claim that the scope for their research includes &ldquo;serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election&rdquo; [<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/tech-executive-fires-back-at-john-durham" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">*</a>]. That has never been part of the typical &ldquo;DNS research&rdquo; scope. It sounds like a flimsy excuse. This is especially true when they contacted a lawyer in the Hillary campaign whose job it was to find dirt on Trump, who took it to the mainstream press right before the election.</p><p>There is a well-known technique for resolving such ethical dilemmas: when you do the questionable thing, do you try to hide, or do you proudly proclaim &ldquo;it was me who did this thing!&rdquo;. If Joffe and Dagan had come forward after the Alfa Bank story was <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported on Slate</a>, especially adding details that had been redacted from the original data, there would be good reason to believe their concern was about what the data said. Instead, they manipulated the data then hid, letting misconceptions about the data fester. It was a political hit, not an investigation into a national security threat.</p><p>As for the YotaPhone data they gave the CIA (discussed in Durham&rsquo;s recent filing), they have a better argument. They didn&rsquo;t go public with the data. Also, they could have legitimately been tracking &ldquo;YotaPhones&rdquo; independently, and that in the course of their investigation, happened to find them at the White House and following Trump on the campaign trail.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure I trust this since it&rsquo;s bogus to believe the YotaPhone is tied to Russia. Yes, it&rsquo;s built by a Russian company, but it was sold mostly in Europe. It&rsquo;s only suspicious if you don&rsquo;t think too hard about it. Given that this came after a clear smear campaign with the Alfa Bank information, I&rsquo;m not sure I believe the innocent excuses.</p><p>Charlie Savage&rsquo;s New York Times article accepts their explanation, that it was part of their legitimate DNS research. I disagree, but I think reasonable people will disagree on this.</p><p>However, the narrative spinning out of control on right-wing sites stoking outrage isn&rsquo;t reasonable. The researchers had legitimate access to mine billions of DNS log entries to hunt down hackers and secure the Internet. There is no hacking, no &ldquo;spying on the White House&rdquo;, and they weren&rsquo;t really in contact with the DNC, much less paid by them. There is no justification, zero, zilch, nada, for saying things like &ldquo;a tech executive broke into the White House&rdquo;, as John Yoo does in the Fox News example above. The most they did was overstep their bounds a little. Yes, I personally disagree with that &mdash; but it&rsquo;s not outrageous.</p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content>

  </figure></p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot while developing S&amp;R, and I wanted to share some of the knowledge I&rsquo;ve gained to people that might be interested in doing a similar project. There is a lot to say about how it works but this blog post will focus on how I&rsquo;ve designed the networking part of the game. I&rsquo;ll first describe the problem in a more formal way. I&rsquo;ll continue by explaining how it&rsquo;s solved in S&amp;R, as well as describe other possible solutions that I&rsquo;ve discovered or imagined. I&rsquo;ll detail the advantages &amp; disadvantages of each method and conclude with which method I think is the best (Spoiler alert: it&rsquo;s the last one &#128064;).</p><h2>Problem statement</h2><p>In a single-player game, everything lives inside a single computer. The player&rsquo;s actions are applied to the game state, and modifications to this game state are reflected on the screen of the player. In an online multiplayer environment, things are different. Each player is playing on its own computer, which all have their own current information about the game, and which all have their own UI to display the current state of the game.</p><p>The general architecture of an online game can be summarized with the following schema:</p><p>The <code>UI</code> displays to the player the current state of the game, based on the local copy of the state of the game. The <code>Clients</code> are responsible for the communication with the server, both to send the actions of the player and to receive new information about the game state.</p><p>The problem we&rsquo;re interested in solving is how to synchronize the different local states of the game of the clients with the game state of the server. More specifically: when the server applies the action of a player to its game state, how must it communicate the modifications to the game state to the clients.</p><h2>Update propagation method</h2><p>The most obvious solution is to apply any action received by the server to the game and transmit the different updates to the state of the game to the clients. The following diagram shows it in action.</p><p>This is the method used by Swords &amp; Ravens. It&rsquo;s simple, intuitive and it&rsquo;s easy to know which kind of data you&rsquo;re sending or not to the different clients. This also makes it trivial to have secret data (i.e. data that should only be known to a subset of the players). If a player draws a card and place it in his (secret) hand, then you can transmit which card was drawn only to this player so that no other player knows which card it is.</p><p>The first downside to this method is that you must code all the possible updates to the state of your game. While there are certainly ways to automate this in JS using, for example, decorators to control the access to the variables of your game state, it may make your code less readable.</p><p>The second downside is that since you&rsquo;re possibly sending multiple updates for a single action, the local game state of a client might temporarily be in an invalid state before all the updates have been received. In the diagram shown above, between the update <code>Remove footman in Winterfell</code> and <code>Add footman in Kings' Landing</code>, there is a missing Footman which would modify the count of Footman shown in the UI. Though this particular issue could be solved by sending a combined update (for example <code>Move Footman Footman from Winterfell to King's Landing</code>), not all updates can easily be concatenated.</p><p>A better way to address this would be to combine all the updates done because of the action and send them at once. This is essentially what the next method is about.</p><h2>Delta-update propagation method</h2><p>The delta-update propagation method works by computing the delta between the new state of the game and the state of the game before the action was applied. This delta is then sent to the clients so that they can apply it to their own local state of the game. This is how the game engine <a href="https://boardgame.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boardgame.io</a> works.</p><p>This solves the 2 downsides described in the previous method. We no longer need to code all the possible updates, since once you change something, it will be computed in the delta after the action has been processed. You no longer get transient invalid states, since the updates will be applied at once, atomically.</p><p>One thing we&rsquo;ve lost, though, is the easiness of managing secret state. If you want to prevent some secret information to be sent to a specific client, the server must filter the delta out of any potential private information before sending it to the clients.</p><h2>Deterministic action propagation method</h2><p>This method is inspired by the deterministic lockstep<sup><a href="https://longwelwind.net#fn-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a></sup> method used in online real-time games.</p><p>It relies on the assumption that processing the actions of a player is deterministic, meaning that for a given state of the game, applying an action will always give us the same resulting state of the game. We can exploit this property to avoid having to propagate the updates to the state of the game to the clients. Instead, the server can apply the action it has received from the client, and then propagate this action to the clients who can then apply the action to derive their own new game state. Since applying the action is deterministic, the clients will arrive at the same state of the game as the server.<sup><a href="https://longwelwind.net#fn-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a></sup></p><p>This solution has numerous advantages compared to the previous ones.</p><p>First, we don&rsquo;t need to code additional network logic in our code. The only thing that needs to be implemented is the propagation of the action done by the players.</p><p>Secondly, bandwidth consumption isn&rsquo;t tied to the size of the modifications done to the game state. If a single player action changes 1000 entities in our game state, the server will still only need to transmit the action and not the changes. This is actually <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/1500-archers-on-a-28-8-network-programming-in-age-of-empires-and-beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the reason why deterministic lockstep is used for real-time strategy games, such as Age of Empires</a>. While it is quite uncommon for turn-based games (even less so for board games) to have lots of moving entities when performing an action, having this opens up new possibilities for turn-based games.</p><p>Thirdly, since the actual gameplay code is run on the client, we can perform animations of the different updates done to the game state. For example, if a player action would reduce their amount of money by 10 and then raise it by 40, we could play 2 different animations client-side while with the previous solution, we would only receive from the server the fact that the amount of money was raised by 30, preventing the client from doing so.</p><p>Fourthly, when the player decides to perform an action, the client can directly apply the action to its own game state after sending it to the server without waiting for confirmation from the server. This process, called &ldquo;optimistic update&rdquo;, allows us to provide a lag-free experience to the players.</p><p>Overall, this solution is quite elegant. We just need to implement the propagation of the actions of the player and once it&rsquo;s done, <em>ta-da</em>, we can focus on implementing the gameplay and don&rsquo;t need to touch the networking code at all!</p><p>There is one big downside, though. To make sure that the clients and the server arrives at the same game state after processing an action, we must ensure that they both possess exactly the same game state initially. At first, this might make you think that it would be impossible to have secret state. Indeed, how could we have state that is only kept server-side if our networking solution relies on the game state being the same between all actors?</p><h3>Handling secret state</h3><p>We can solve this issue quite elegantly by allowing the clients to slightly differ from the server. If an action requires state that was previously hidden to one or multiple clients, we can make the server reconciliates the difference by sending this specific part of the game state to the clients. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with an example from Swords &amp; Ravens. When a player moves their army into the territory of another player, they trigger a combat. Resolving a combat in S&amp;R involves both players simultaneously choosing, from their hand, a general of their house to lead their armies. This mechanic leads to intense mind-games where both players try to guess which general their opponent will take so they can pick the appropriate counter, while wondering if their opponent will not plan for this and take the counter of the counter, requiring you to pick the counter of the counter of the counter, and so on.</p><p>Obviously, it is important to keep secret the choice of one of the opposing players if the other player has not made their choice yet.</p><p>The following diagram explains how we could solve this.</p><p>When <code>Client A</code> sends their action to the server (Choosing Tywin Lannister), we propagate this action to both players, but not before filtering the chosen leader out of the message sent to <code>Client B</code>. At this point, <code>Client B</code>&rsquo;s game state differs from <code>Server</code>&rsquo;s game state since it does not know which leader <code>A</code> has chosen. When <code>Client B</code> sends their action (Choosing Margaery Tyrell), we apply the same logic and filter out the chosen leader out of the message sent to <code>Client A</code>. Since both players have chosen their leaders, we can reconciliate the differences in game state by sending out the choice of the other players. After this little manoeuver, all clients have the same game state and can resolve the rest of the combat deterministically.</p><p>Note that while we could have opted not to send anything to <code>Client B</code> after <code>A</code> had chosen their leader, sending this information makes it possible to display in the UI of <code>B</code> that <code>A</code> has already chosen their leader.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If I had to develop Swords &amp; Ravens from scratch, I would do it using a deterministic method. Having to implement the networking only once, and be done with it, is quite elegant and appealing. Since AGoT:TBG is quite a complex game with a lot of different phases, having to network every interaction produced a lot of boilerplate code, which amounts to a big portion of the code. On top of that, I never managed to easily add animations (pieces moving, cards moving from hand to board, &hellip;) to the UI, which does not help a lot with AGoT:TBG where a single action can have a lot of state updates.</p><p>Another nice thing about using a deterministic method is that you can easily make a library that handles all the networking part of a turn-based game, letting the developer focus on developing the mechanics of the game itself. I&rsquo;ve started working on such a library, <a href="https://ravens.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ravens</a>. Unfortunately, due to external circumstances, I have not continued developing it.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re actually in the process of implementing a turn-based multiplayer game, I hope that this article was able to help you on choosing a sound architecture. If not, then I hope the content and the writing was interesting enough!</p></article></div>]]></content>

I eventually pleaded guilty to charges of blackmail, fraud, and computer hacking. Following that, I was sentenced to four years in prison. I'm currently on probation for a year, and I'm also under the supervision of the Serious Organised Crime Unit for another four years. I'm bound by a number of technical constraints. The authorities in charge of my supervision are happy for me to find legal work in cybersecurity, but given my current circumstances, I just wanted opinions on how I should approach this.<p>I'm completely self-taught, and while on bail, I did a lot of responsible disclosure. I collaborated closely with CIRT teams, system administrators, website developers, and government agencies to ensure the remediation of over 3,000 web-application vulnerabilities. I wrote technical reports, provided remediation guidance, and validated patches to ensure that security issues were properly closed (in an informal capacity). My first bug bounty contribution took place in 2012 which was a GET-based reflective XSS on a subdomain belonging to Microsoft.</p><p>Over 30 private and public sector entities have sent me letters of acknowledgement. I've also been inducted into a number of hall of fames for uncovering vulnerabilities. In 2019, I was also ranked 11th out of 25,000 active researchers on a bug bounty platform.</p><p>I can't just walk into employment with my skillset because I'm not particularly talented, just proficient in web-application security and various methodology used to identify vulnerabilities. This leads me to believe that I should look for entry-level positions but I've been told I'm overqualified. Some opinions would be appreciated.</p></td></div>]]></content>

				<h2>Senators Call for Critically Needed Transparency About CIA Bulk Collection; Documents Declassified at Wyden and Heinrich&rsquo;s Request
			
			</h2><p><span><b><i>Washington, D.C.</i></b> &ndash; U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., both members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for new transparency about bulk surveillance conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency, following the release of documents that revealed a secret bulk collection program and problems with how the agency searches and handles Americans&rsquo; information.</span></p>
<p><span>Wyden and Heinrich requested the declassification of a report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on a CIA bulk collection program, in a letter sent April 13, 2021. The letter, which was declassified and made public today reveals that &ldquo;the CIA has secretly conducted its own bulk program,&rdquo; authorized under Executive Order 12333, rather than the laws passed by Congress.</span></p>
<p><span>The letter notes that the program was &ldquo;entirely outside the statutory framework that Congress and the public believe govern this collection, and without any of the judicial, congressional or even executive branch oversight that comes from [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] collection.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><b>&ldquo;FISA gets all the attention because of the periodic congressional reauthorizations and the release of DOJ, ODNI and FISA Court documents,&rdquo;</b> said Senators Wyden and Heinrich <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about/organization/privacy-and-civil-liberties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in response to the newly declassified documents.</a>&nbsp; <b>&ldquo;But what these documents demonstrate is that many of the same concerns that Americans have about their privacy and civil liberties also apply to how the CIA collects and handles information under executive order and outside the FISA law.&nbsp; In particular, these documents reveal serious problems associated with warrantless backdoor searches of Americans, the same issue that has generated bipartisan concern in the FISA context.&rdquo;</b></span></p>
<p><span>Wyden and Heinrich called for more transparency from the CIA, including what kind of records were collected and the legal framework for the collection. The PCLOB report noted problems with CIA&rsquo;s handling and searching of Americans&rsquo; information under the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;While we appreciate the release of the &lsquo;Recommendations from PCLOB Staff&rsquo; which highlights problems associated with the handling of Americans&rsquo; information, our letter also stressed that the public deserves to know more about the collection of this information.&nbsp; The DNI and the CIA Director have started this process.&nbsp; We intend to continue to urge them to achieve the transparency the American people deserve.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The Wyden-Heinrich letter is <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/hainesburns_wydenheinrich_13apr21_final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>A portion of PCLOB&rsquo;s report on the program <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about/organization/privacy-and-civil-liberties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was made public here.</a></span></p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30245842" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div><p><span><p>When Kate Wilson was 23, she got deceived into having sex with an older guy who wasn&rsquo;t what he appeared to be. To her, he was Mark Stone, a radical environmental activist who shared her taste in country music and her belief that capitalism is destroying the planet. He wrote poetry for her, went to her grandmother&rsquo;s 90th birthday party, and helped her organize a massive protest against the G-8 summit in Scotland. They lived together nearly two years as lovers and stayed close friends for years after.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>But seven years after they first met, in 2010, their intimate relationship imploded when Wilson learned the shocking truth about Stone&rsquo;s true identity. Not only was his real last name &ldquo;Kennedy.&rdquo; Not only did he have a wife and two kids. But the person <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/21/i-was-abused-undercover-policeman-mark-kennedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with whom</a> Wilson had &ldquo;shared many of my interests and dreams,&rdquo; who <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/our-stories/kates-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told her </a>&ldquo;lots of his most intimate stories and secrets,&rdquo; was actually working for the British state.</p></span><span><p>In 2003, Kennedy had been sent undercover by an elite unit in London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police Service to gather intelligence on activists like Wilson. He spent seven years living a double life: He was a fearless organizer who had a shadowy backstory as a cocaine runner, but he was also a cop with a family in Ireland.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Until the day he was &ldquo;outed&rdquo; by a small group of sleuthing activists, Kennedy was a trusted leader in a movement that was desperately trying to wake up Britain and the world to the impending horrors of the climate emergency. But his friends, comrades, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58749590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 10 other women</a> he had sex with had no idea Kennedy was selling them out to governments and corporations that had a vested interest in keeping the country hooked on fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><p><span><p>This wasn&rsquo;t just a personal betrayal. &ldquo;He was controlling people&rsquo;s ability to organize politically,&rdquo; Wilson told VICE World News. &ldquo;That is profoundly anti-democratic.&rdquo;</p></span></p><p><span><p>Nearly 20 years after Kennedy first met Wilson and manipulated his way into her bedroom, the legal consequences are still unfolding. A judicial authority known as the Investigatory Powers Tribunal made a damning decision about Kennedy last September.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>The court ruled that Kennedy &ldquo;debased, degraded, and humiliated&rdquo; Wilson. He &ldquo;invaded the core of her private life&rdquo; and &ldquo;caused her mental suffering.&rdquo; He &ldquo;interfered&rdquo; with her &ldquo;sexual autonomy&rdquo; and showed &ldquo;a profound lack of respect&rdquo; for her &ldquo;bodily integrity and human dignity.&rdquo; It was an &ldquo;abuse of the highest order.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>The Investigatory Powers Tribunal concluded, &ldquo;This is not just a case about a renegade police officer, who took advantage of his undercover deployment to indulge his sexual proclivities.&rdquo; It described &ldquo;disturbing and lamentable failings at the most fundamental levels.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>The ruling stated that the UK&rsquo;s largest police force had adopted a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; policy toward Kennedy having sex while undercover, &ldquo;or more probably a lack of interest in protecting women.&rdquo; It said activists such as Wilson never should have been targeted for their political beliefs.</p></span><span><p>The Metropolitan Police isn&rsquo;t disputing the judgment. &ldquo;We accept and recognise the gravity of all of the breaches of Ms. Wilson&rsquo;s human rights as found by the tribunal,&rdquo; it says in a statement provided to VICE World News. &ldquo;[We] unreservedly apologise to Ms. Wilson for the damage caused, and the hurt she has suffered from the deployment of these undercover officers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span><p>Wilson <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/our-stories/kates-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had previously said</a> that learning about Kennedy&rsquo;s true identity &ldquo;was like a computer virus. It&rsquo;s corrupted all my memories of those times, and it affects all the relationships that I&rsquo;ve had since.&rdquo;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436084633-katewilsonmarkkennedysmiling.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Senior officers knew about or tolerated Kennedy's relationship with Wilson, the tribunal found.

Photo: Kate Wilson</p></div></div><p><span><p>The court decision this fall, which was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-58749590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major news</a> across much of Europe but barely noticed in the U.S. and Canada, was the result of a 10-year legal battle by Wilson. &ldquo;In terms of emotional closure, it&rsquo;s all quite complicated,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In the end, the judgment was a much bigger victory than I expected it to be.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>The ruling was a vindication for <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-06/uk-women-discover-boyfriends-were-undercover-police-officers/12949940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dozens of other women</a> who have come forward across the UK saying they also were deceived into sexual relationships with undercover officers. The tribunal will now be deciding what damages Wilson should receive.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>But Kennedy caused harm that some of Wilson&rsquo;s friends and former activist colleagues say is not only personal, but actually planetary. They say that the dirty tricks he played, carried out on behalf of a police force <a href="https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/Spycops%20in%20context%20%E2%80%93%20counter-subversion%2C%20deep%20dissent%20and%20the%20logic%20of%20political%20policing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hostile to political dissent</a>, hobbled a climate movement whose goal was to prevent death and destruction from an overheated planet.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was controlling people&rsquo;s ability to organize politically.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><span><p>VICE World News spoke with more than half a dozen people closely involved with the UK climate movement who came in contact with &ldquo;Mark Stone&rdquo; during the 2000s. Some of them, like Wilson, are still attempting to rebuild their lives. They have been largely unable to engage in climate activism since Kennedy was exposed. And they say the shockwaves of distrust and paranoia he sent into their community destabilized a movement that was on the verge of making a huge political impact.</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s roll back history a bit,&rdquo; said Harry Halpin, a former climate organizer from the U.S. who said <a href="https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/new-twist-in-british-spys-case-unravels-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was tracked by FBI agents</a> after attending activist meetings with Kennedy. Halpin said there was real global momentum building behind a climate protest movement during the late 2000s. But instead of &ldquo;pressuring governments with the help of scientists to stop climate change,&rdquo; it largely fizzled. He holds Kennedy partly responsible.</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be very clear: Mark intentionally destroyed that process,&rdquo; said Halpin, who <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/08/25/chelsea-manning-is-back-and-hacking-again-only-this-time-for-a-bitcoin-based-privacy-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now runs</a> an internet privacy company that employs Chelsea Manning. &ldquo;He did that by picking on key people and destroying their lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span><p>Mark Kennedy often seemed to be looking in two directions at the same time. At 2 years old, he got a staple <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/26/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-environmental-activist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stuck in his eye</a> while playing in a cardboard box and the injury left him with muscle damage and the ability to only focus one eye.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>He joined the Metropolitan Police in his 20s, and in 1999 he completed a course that trained officers how to go undercover to bust drug dealers. &ldquo;I was a natural at undercover work and I loved it,&rdquo; he <a href="https://powerbase.info/index.php/Mark_Kennedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later told</a> the <em>Daily Mail</em>. &ldquo;Drug work was black-and-white. You identify the bad guys, record and film the evidence, present it in court, and take them down. I did that for four years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642436859404-markkennedyheadonstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Mark Kennedy in 2011.

Photo by Nick Stern</p></div></div><p><span><p>Though Kennedy&rsquo;s work doesn&rsquo;t appear to have resulted in any notable cases, it caught the attention of his superiors. In 2002 he passed a series of tests that allowed him to begin working with the&nbsp;National Public Order Intelligence Unit, set up to monitor extremist groups that the police feared could cause public disruption and violence. In practice, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Order_Intelligence_Unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many of the unit&rsquo;s targets</a> were activists working on social justice, anti-racist, and environmental campaigns. Since the 1960s, more than 144 undercover officers have spied on over 1,000 political groups, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/27/undercover-police-spied-on-more-than-1000-political-groups-in-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a public inquiry revealed</a>.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>Kennedy relocated to the English city of Nottingham, a three-hour drive north of London. He said he chose the last name &ldquo;Stone&rdquo; more or less at random because it sounded neutral. It was common practice for undercover officers with the unit to keep their first names. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important if you&rsquo;re stuck in a crowd and somebody&rsquo;s shouting at you to do something or calling you, you need to be able to react,&rdquo; Kennedy <a href="https://vimeo.com/32210258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the British broadcaster Channel 4. &nbsp;</p></span><span><p>VICE World News asked Kennedy for an interview through his LinkedIn page, but he didn&rsquo;t respond to the request.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>His first assignment was to infiltrate a community space known as the Sumac Centre, a gathering place where activists strategized, cooked vegan food, hosted parties, and screened films. Kennedy prepared for the job by buying black clothes, piercing his ears, and letting his hair grow long, according to an account in <em>Undercover: The True Story of Britain&rsquo;s Secret Police</em>, a book by <em>Guardian</em> journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>He also invented a backstory. Kennedy had always been good at climbing, so he decided he would present himself as a professional rope technician who did work on cranes and skyscrapers. This would be a convenient way to explain his frequent disappearances. To help explain his generous expense account from the police, he pretended he had previously made a lot of money smuggling cocaine from Pakistan.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>&ldquo;This was not something he would ever announce. Instead, it was a secret that would unfurl slowly, providing a second layer to his identity,&rdquo; Evans and Lewis write in <em>Undercover</em>. &ldquo;He could be a risk-taker thirsting for excitement, and someone wanting also to seek redemption for past failures.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Within a few months of hanging out at the Sumac Centre, Kennedy started focusing his attention on Kate Wilson, a woman in her early 20s who travelled internationally for environmental camps and conferences and knew activists across the world. She spoke several languages and had recently worked as a translator in Venezuela, at one point translating a speech by President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez. Kennedy piqued her interest. &ldquo;He was very charismatic, exciting, good fun,&rdquo; Wilson later told Evans and Lewis. &ldquo;He was quite a lot older than me&mdash;nearly 10 years older. He was very romantic, and that set the tone for our relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Kennedy and Wilson were soon dating. &ldquo;He frequently took [Wilson] out to dinner,&rdquo; the tribunal judgment reads. &ldquo;He bought her gifts. They went on day trips, weekends away, and holidays. He wrote to her in affectionate and loving terms. He wrote her poetry. He taught her to drive his van and let her use it when he was away.&rdquo;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642437669846-katewilsonmarkkennedy90th.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Mark Kennedy even went to Kate Wilson's grandmother's 90th birthday party.

Kennedy built Wilson &ldquo;a four-poster bed out of scaffolding. They used [Wilson&rsquo;s] room as a study and spare room with a futon for sleeping on. On one occasion, [Wilson&rsquo;s] parents stayed in [Mark Kennedy&rsquo;s] room,&rdquo; the judgment reads. Kennedy used his undercover budget to buy Wilson gifts, at one point asking his deployment manager for cash to get her a used mountain bike.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>As Wilson fell in love with someone she knew as Mark Stone, Kennedy the cop was filing reports about her back to his superiors. &ldquo;[She] was identified by MK as an influential person in the world of activism almost at the beginning of this operation,&rdquo; said an internal report <a href="https://www.ipt-uk.com/judgments.asp?id=61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal</a>. &ldquo;As such, the operation has utilised her reputation, knowledge, energy, and contacts (both national and international) to progress and promote [MK&rsquo;s] own standing.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>From the beginning of their relationship, Wilson and Kennedy were organizing political events. With leaders of the world&rsquo;s top eight economic powers set to meet in Scotland in 2005 for the G-8 summit, Wilson and Kennedy set to work coordinating the agenda and logistics for a massive anti-globalization protest. Thousands showed up to pressure then&ndash;Prime Minister Tony Blair, George W. Bush, and other leaders to take action on fixing climate change and global poverty.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Earlier that year, Wilson and Kennedy had ended their romantic relationship when Wilson decided to move to Barcelona. &ldquo;Despite that, they remained close and affectionate,&rdquo; the tribunal document reads. &ldquo;MK also remained in contact with her family after the breakup.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>By then, Wilson had served the required role for Kennedy&rsquo;s mission. Within the space of two years, he had gone from being a newcomer at the Sumac Centre to a trusted figure within the UK&rsquo;s radical activist movement.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><p><span><p>During the G-8 in northern Scotland, protesters set up a campsite 12 miles from Gleneagles Hotel, where the summit was taking place, to house the thousands of activists coming from all over Europe and the world. Kennedy was put in charge of logistics. He drove around the country securing portable toilets, tents, and other supplies. By some accounts, Kennedy performed his job well, which earned him the new nickname &ldquo;Transport Mark.&rdquo;</p></span></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He offered to buy rounds of beer; that made him quite popular.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><span><p>In addition to being useful to the movement, Kennedy could also be lots of fun to be around. &ldquo;He was a nice guy, super friendly, really easy to get along with,&rdquo; said Jason Kirkpatrick, a climate activist who first met Kennedy around this time, and is working on a documentary about undercover policing <a href="http://spiedupon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called </a><em><a href="http://spiedupon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spied Upon</a></em>. &ldquo;He had some money, he offered to buy rounds of beer; that made him quite popular.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>For many activists at the G-8 summit, staying in the camp itself was one of the highlights. They cooked communal meals, networked, partied, and practiced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct democracy</a>, a decentralized form of decision-making where everyone, at least in theory, has equal say and power. That got some climate activists thinking: What if they made camps like this a regular thing?&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span><p>The following year, in August 2006, activists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_for_Climate_Action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set up a &ldquo;Climate Camp&rdquo;</a> outside the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, England, about an hour-and-a-half drive east of Manchester. Drax at the time was the biggest coal plant in Western Europe and one of the UK&rsquo;s largest carbon polluters. By setting up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/01/energy.activists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a carnivalesque camp</a> outside the facility, activists hoped to draw the public&rsquo;s attention to the climate emergency and identify coal plants as one of the main culprits.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>But some activists wanted to go further. They wanted to shut down the plant altogether.</p></span><span><p>Kennedy was part of a team tasked with making that happen. &ldquo;I came up with the suggestion to bury wire cutters around the perimeter fence,&rdquo; he <a href="https://vimeo.com/32210258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later told Channel 4</a>. The plan was for activists to slash holes in the fence, run inside the coal plant, and temporarily force the plant to close. But when activists got to the fence on Aug. 31, they were ambushed by a squadron of riot police&mdash;Kennedy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a> an interview he did with the <em>Daily Mail</em>, had tipped them off.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642456573702-tightsecuritydraxpowerstationselby.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt='Tight security around Drax power station, where activists were gathering for a "Camp for Climate Action" in August 2006.

Not knowing he was an undercover officer, five officers swarmed him. &ldquo;They had batons and pummelled my head. They punched me. One officer repeatedly stamped on my back,&rdquo; he <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later told the </a><em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a></em>.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>All of Kennedy&rsquo;s recollections should be viewed with some skepticism, according to the tribunal. It deemed him a &ldquo;highly unreliable narrator&rdquo; and, given his long history of deception, &ldquo;we do not consider we can put any weight on statements and comments he has made.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>Within the movement, though, Kennedy now had a proven track record as an organizer and the battle scars to prove it.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>But as the months and years went on, some climate activists still had trouble putting their faith in him. It was the day-to-day things that made him seem out of place. His seemingly endless supply of cash was suspect. Kennedy ate meat and kind of talked like a bro. &ldquo;I never trusted him because he was macho as fuck,&rdquo; Jay Jordan, a climate organizer who worked occasionally with Kennedy during this era, told VICE World News.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Kennedy&rsquo;s political views seemed unsophisticated. &ldquo;He was not the most intellectual guy in the bunch, and when I say that, I mean he didn&rsquo;t really grasp very well complicated political topics,&rdquo; Kirkpatrick said. &ldquo;So if we tried to get down to a serious discussion on climate change, he would kind of go, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s enough for me. The problems are clear; we need to do something.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>The activists suppressed their doubts. Some of them were educated intellectuals who didn&rsquo;t want to write him off just because he seemed working-class. And Kennedy was always eager to help out. Plus, he had a van. (What they didn&rsquo;t know was that by driving people home after protests, he could gain information about where they lived.)</p></span></p><p><span><p>Crucially, after Kennedy and Wilson broke things off, Kennedy quickly got into another&nbsp;long-term relationship with a woman who goes in public <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/our-stories/lisas-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the pseudonym Lisa</a>. Jordan believes these relationships were crucial for Kennedy&rsquo;s undercover work. &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t been with the women he was with&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d have been able to do the work he was doing,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;He totally used [them] as a way in and to gain trust.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>By 2009, Kennedy was using that trust to work with a small group of climate activists on a top-secret mission. Their target was Ratcliffe-on-Soar, another massive coal-fired plant, this one south of Nottingham, the city where Kennedy had first begun his deployment. They figured if they could recruit dozens of activists from around the country, break into the facility, turn off the generator, and occupy the power station for a week, it would create a media spectacle that would embarrass the UK government and create public pressure to move the country off coal.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642460371612-ratcliffeonsoarprotest.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Police deal with climate change protesters at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in October 2009.

Photo by David Jones/PA Images via Getty Images</p></div></div><p><span><p>Kennedy was involved almost from the start. He drove a few of the activists in the planning committee on a scouting mission around the plant. But they had no idea that Kennedy had been ordered by his superiors to prevent the protest from happening. A confidential document from the National Public Order Intelligence Unit cited in <em>Undercover</em> stated that if activists successfully shut down Ratcliffe-on-Soar, it could cause &ldquo;severe economic loss to the United Kingdom and have an adverse impact on the public&rsquo;s feeling of safety and security.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>Danny Chivers was one of dozens of people invited to take part in the direct action. The invitation was short on details. He was told to show up at a school in the suburbs of Nottingham, prepare to spend the night, and not bring his phone. &ldquo;That sounds interesting,&rdquo; Chivers thought. When he got to the school on April 12, 2009, organizers briefed the crowd on the plan to occupy the coal plant the following day and warned that anyone who participated would likely be arrested. They gave people until 3 a.m. to decide if they wanted to join.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Chivers debated what to do. &ldquo;At this point I&rsquo;d never been arrested at a protest,&rdquo; he told VICE World News. &ldquo;So it was like, &lsquo;OK, am I genuinely ready for this?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Unbeknownst to the crowd, Kennedy was secretly recording the entire meeting with a police-issued wristwatch. Chivers was in his sleeping bag and still hadn&rsquo;t made up his mind about whether he&rsquo;d join the direct action when, shortly after midnight, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/13/nottingham-police-raid-environmental-campaigners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">police raided the school</a>. &ldquo;There was this loud banging on the door, and suddenly hundreds of police officers stormed the building,&rdquo; he said.</p></span><span><p>A police officer stood in the middle of the room, according to an account of the event in <em>Undercover</em>. &ldquo;You are all under arrest on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and/or criminal damage at a power industry facility,&rdquo; the officer said. Altogether, 114 people were arrested.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>The year before the Ratcliffe-on-Soar raid, in 2008, Kennedy travelled to New York City to spy on a meeting of anti-capitalists from the U.S. and Europe. Halpin, the U.S. climate organizer who now runs an internet privacy company, was one of the people there. He&rsquo;d first met Kennedy a while back at a bar in the UK. &ldquo;He struck me as not very bright,&rdquo; Halpin told VICE World News. Halpin was a young, radical computer scientist working on a graduate degree who was involved with the Climate Camp movement. He had friends who were climate scientists, and he became convinced the global emergency would keep getting worse without intense pressure from civil society. &ldquo;Nothing felt as important as the climate,&rdquo; he said.</p></span><span><p>The meeting in New York was nothing special, according to Halpin, who is originally from the U.S. Activists debated protest techniques, talked about the ecological crisis, and complained about the lack of social spaces to organize. Halpin claimed that at one point Kennedy got bored and left the meeting to go drinking. &ldquo;It was a bit of a pointless meeting,&rdquo; Kennedy <a href="http://www.davidkushner.com/article/undercover-anarchist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later acknowledged</a> to <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p></span><span><p>But after that trip to New York, Halpin began to feel targeted by police for his activism. Back in Europe, Halpin attended a meeting where activists strategized about how to influence the upcoming international climate negotiations being hosted in Copenhagen. Kennedy was also present. When Halpin returned to England, he got stopped at the border and interrogated as if he were a terrorist. &ldquo;They forced me to give over my biometrics against my will,&rdquo; he claimed.</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8p3m/racism-wasnt-a-problem-for-british-police-in-the-70s-says-spy-cop-who-used-racist-term" tabindex="-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset=" , "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset=" , "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset=" , "></source><img alt=""></picture></div></div></a></div></div></div><p><span><p>Later that year, Halpin went to Copenhagen to join a demonstration pressuring leaders to adopt an aggressive climate deal. Without such a deal, they feared, developing countries would become increasingly vulnerable to floods, extreme weather, drought, famine, and resulting political instability.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>But the protest didn&rsquo;t have the impact Halpin had hoped for. Danish police showed up and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/copenhagen-arrests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested more</a> than 230 people. &ldquo;I was beaten,&rdquo; Halpin said. &ldquo;They broke my glasses.&rdquo; Halpin said he was taken to a private jail cell. He was later told he was a suspected &ldquo;terrorist,&rdquo; but without evidence to charge him, Danish police let him go.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>In the meantime, the Copenhagen negotiations ended in a stalemate between major world polluters. It was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-deal-expert-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;spectacular failure&rdquo;</a> in the eyes of some observers.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>The experience shook Halpin. When he was later offered a job interview at MIT with Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the World Wide Web, Halpin figured it might be a good time to leave. But when he landed in the U.S., Halpin said police pulled him aside and <a href="https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/new-twist-in-british-spys-case-unravels-in-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned him for hours</a>. They showed him a photo from a climate protest he&rsquo;d been at that Kennedy had also attended. Later, he claimed, two FBI agents showed up in the middle of his interview with Berners-Lee. (Halpin&rsquo;s name is listed in FBI documents from 2008 that were viewed by VICE World News.) He quickly found an attorney, who advised him to go back to Europe.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><p><span><p>A judge-led inquiry about spy cops now underway in the UK <a href="http://campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/2016/02/08/targeted-activists-call-for-list-of-all-spycops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes Halpin&rsquo;s name</a> on a list of people targeted by undercover police. Set up in 2015 by former British Prime Minister Theresa May, this Undercover Policing Inquiry is considering decades worth of evidence about the UK&rsquo;s covert police programs <a href="https://www.ucpi.org.uk/about-the-inquiry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to make recommendations</a> about how &ldquo;undercover policing should be conducted in future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Around the time that Halpin was having run-ins with the FBI, Chivers, the activist who got arrested before the Ratcliffe-on-Soar protest, was also feeling uncertain about his future. After the arrests at the school, the authorities charged 26 protesters with conspiracy to commit trespass, an offence that could potentially result in three months in prison. Twenty of those activists were people who had decided before the raid they would be part of the power plant occupation. They intended to argue in court that their actions were warranted by the seriousness of the climate emergency, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/14/ratcliffe-coal-james-hansen-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually arranged</a> to have NASA scientist and climate expert James Hansen speak in court on their behalf.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Chivers belonged to a smaller group of six who had a separate attorney and were planning to argue they hadn&rsquo;t decided to join the action before police arrested them. &ldquo;We were basically on trial just for thinking about it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span><p>With many of the arrested activists out on bail, Kennedy and seven other activist friends decided to host a huge multi-day rager to celebrate their 40th birthdays. They formed a rock band called the 69ers. The plan was to perform cover songs such as &ldquo;Anarchy in the UK&rdquo; by the Sex Pistols for a drunken crowd out in a barn in a rural area of Herefordshire.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642459460866-markkennedyconcert40thstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Kennedy with his band&mdash;the 69ers&mdash;performs at his own 40th birthday in 2009.

Over the coming days and weeks, he started acting paranoid and jumpy, Jack told VICE World News. It seemed like Kennedy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Kennedy&rsquo;s friends were legitimately concerned. They didn&rsquo;t know faking a downward mental spiral and abruptly disappearing were standard training for undercover officers ending their deployment&mdash;although in Kennedy&rsquo;s case, some of the anguish may have been genuine, Jack and other activists later speculated. Not long after the birthday party, Kennedy told people he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well. He said he was going to visit his brother in the U.S. And then he left.</p></span><span><p>Kennedy&rsquo;s exit strategy seemed to be going exactly to plan. But several months later, he suddenly reappeared back in England. His old friends were confused about how everything had gone down but happy he&rsquo;d returned. Nobody knew it at the time, but Kennedy appears to have traded the police for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/12/mark-kennedy-policeman-corporate-spy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new employer</a>.</p></span></p><p><span><p>Around this time, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he says he began working</a> as a consultant for a corporate intelligence agency called Global Open. One of its clients was E.ON, the operator of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station. The <em>Guardian </em>and <em>Daily Mail </em>reported on documents showing that Kennedy set up a company with the same address as a former Global Open director. However, a Global Open representative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/12/mark-kennedy-policeman-corporate-spy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/12/mark-kennedy-policeman-corporate-spy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian</a></em> it had never employed the former cop. And, the <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://mob.indymedia.org.uk/images/2011/01/471947.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a>, &ldquo;E.ON would not confirm or deny whether Kennedy worked for it.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>Before Kennedy&rsquo;s police operation ended, he&rsquo;d had to turn over all the fake documents that police had created for him. He no longer had a passport in the name of Mark Stone.</p></span><span><p>The details of what happened next were provided to VICE World News by Jack. His account also tracks what reporters have described in the book <em>Undercover</em>, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/20/lisa-jones-girlfriend-of-undercover-police-office-mark-kennedy-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other</a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/20/lisa-jones-girlfriend-of-undercover-police-office-mark-kennedy-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/20/lisa-jones-girlfriend-of-undercover-police-office-mark-kennedy-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media reporting</a>. In the summer of 2010, Kennedy and his then-girlfriend Lisa went on vacation to Italy. One day while Kennedy was gone, Lisa began rifling around in their van&rsquo;s glovebox for some sunglasses. She pulled out a passport that had Kennedy&rsquo;s real name on it. It said he was a father. She found an iPhone and it contained emails addressed to &ldquo;dad.&rdquo;</p></span></p><div><p><span><p>When Kennedy returned, Lisa confronted him. &ldquo;He absolutely broke down,&rdquo; said Jack, who remains close friends with Lisa. Through sobs, Kennedy said he was using the name Stone even though his legal name was Kennedy to throw off inquiries into his drug-dealing past. He said the kid was actually the son of his former drug-running partner and that when the partner had died Kennedy had adopted the kid as his own.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Lisa wanted to believe him. They&rsquo;d been together for years at that point. Kennedy had gone to her dad&rsquo;s funeral. But something didn&rsquo;t sit right with her.</p></span></p><p><span><p>Several months later, Lisa confided her doubts in Jack, who was an amateur expert in genealogical research. He couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence of a Mark Stone, but he did find public records of a Mark Kennedy with a wife and two children. After further digging, he located a birth certificate for one of Kennedy&rsquo;s kids. It listed the dad&rsquo;s occupation as &ldquo;police officer.&rdquo; &ldquo;My heart was just racing,&rdquo; Jack said. They got another friend in Dublin to pull up records on Kennedy&rsquo;s wife and they found a phone number. Lisa dialled the number and Kennedy answered the phone. &ldquo;You need to come here and explain the truth,&rdquo; Lisa said, according to the friend.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>When Kennedy arrived at a house in Nottingham, six people were waiting for him, including Lisa and Jack. It was past 1 a.m., and they all sat in the living room. Kennedy fessed up to having a wife and children but kept telling improbable lies about his past. Finally, one person in the room asked him straight-up: &ldquo;When did you join the police?&rdquo; Kennedy looked up at the ceiling and exhaled deeply, according to Jack. Only then did Kennedy admit he was a cop.</p></span></p></div><p><span><p>The activists made their discovery public on IndyMedia UK, a platform where people could post about &ldquo;important social and political issues&rdquo; that weren&rsquo;t being covered in the mainstream media. &ldquo;Mark &lsquo;Stone/Kennedy&rsquo; exposed as undercover police officer,&rdquo; their <a href="https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2010/10/466477.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post read</a>. &ldquo;A face-to-face confession has confirmed this.&rdquo; Initially nobody outside their circles paid much attention. But the legal implications for activists facing jail time in the Ratcliffe-on-Soar trial were immediately obvious. The prosecution hadn&rsquo;t made it known in court that the arrests were due to an undercover officer. If Kennedy&rsquo;s wristwatch recording of the raid was made public, it would show that Chivers and other activists had never officially consented to taking part in the coal-plant occupation.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;The case against us collapsed,&rdquo; Chivers said. &ldquo;We were able to get it overturned.&rdquo;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458369247-ratcliffeonsoardannychivers.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt=" Danny Chivers, second from right, was one of six defendants whose charges were dropped in Nottingham Crown Court in 2011, following revelations about Kennedy infiltrating the climate movement.

In those early stories, Kennedy portrayed himself as a tortured soul who&rsquo;d fallen in love with people that he&rsquo;d been assigned to spy on. &ldquo;I do miss her so much,&rdquo; Kennedy said of the person known as Lisa <a href="https://vimeo.com/32210258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a tearful interview</a> with Channel 4<em>. </em>&ldquo;Despite everything, you know, I still lied to her.&rdquo;</p></span></p><p><span><p>But Kennedy&rsquo;s former activist friends were not feeling particularly sympathetic. The news of his true identity came at a perilous time for the climate movement. The Copenhagen climate talks had ended in failure. Climate deniers <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were feeling emboldened</a> after a hacker stole and made public over 1,000 emails from UK climate researchers, an event the deniers dubbed &ldquo;Climategate&rdquo; that falsely purported to show the researchers expressing doubts about climate science. In the U.S., a major bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cap+and+trade+new+yorker+ryan+lizza&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS911US911&amp;oq=cap+and+trade+new+yorker+ryan+lizza&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.8321j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had collapsed</a>.&nbsp;</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458719290-markkennedytattoosnickstern.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Mark Kennedy in 2011.

Photo by Nick Stern</p></div></div><div><p><span><p>On top of all that, many activists in the Climate Camp movement were burning out after years of organizing. They were getting older and dropping out. The Kennedy news, Chivers said, &ldquo;was another gut punch.&rdquo; It was &ldquo;part of this great sucking-out of energy when we needed to stay strong,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Jordan agrees that learning about Kennedy&rsquo;s betrayal frayed trust that had taken years to build. &ldquo;The effect it has on the movement is it makes you doubt everything,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>For Wilson, the news about Kennedy blew up her sense of identity. &ldquo;The impact of that, the grief and the paranoia, and the sense of shame really paralysed me for a very, very long time,&rdquo; <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/our-stories/kates-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she later said</a>. Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/11/activist-undercover-officer-violated-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">further investigations</a> from the <em>Guardian</em> about the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, other social justice and environmental activists began to come forward with stories about undercover police who had tricked them into relationships.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>In December 2011, Wilson and seven other women launched legal action against the Metropolitan Police. &ldquo;It is unacceptable that state agents can cultivate intimate and long-lasting relationships with political activists in order to gain so-called intelligence on those political movements,&rdquo; they <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/legal-action-against-metropolitan-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>While their legal case moved forward, Kennedy was searching for new jobs in the U.S. In 2011, he contacted Stratfor, which provides intelligence services for corporations. In an email later made public by WikiLeaks, Kennedy <a href="https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2013/11/513820.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to </a>Stratfor he has &ldquo;an in-depth understanding of the trends and influences of activism on a domestic and international level, having infiltrated many groups throughout eight years of international deployment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;Very impressive undercover work,&rdquo; one Stratfor analyst <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=1677168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a separate email</a> to a colleague that was also leaked. &ldquo;He sure looks like a dirty hippy.&rdquo; Stratfor didn&rsquo;t respond to a media request from VICE World News about these emails.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>Not long after, Kennedy updated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-kennedy-19885344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his LinkedIn profile</a> to say he was now a consultant for the Densus Group, a &ldquo;boutique risk management company&rdquo; that among other assignments <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55d75350e4b0acedf37444ac/t/59378d0e4402437bdc8b0e55/1496812816274/Densus+White+Paper+Oil+and+Gas+Financial+Impact_16+MAR+17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has advised pipeline companies</a> on how to deal with protests from Indigenous tribes and environmental groups. His profile currently says he lives in West Hollywood, California. The Densus Group didn&rsquo;t reply to an inquiry from VICE World News asking if Kennedy works with the company currently or has ever worked for it.</p></span></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Senior officers either knew of the relationship, chose not to know of its existence, or were incompetent and negligent.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><span><p>Back in the UK, the Metropolitan Police issued an official apology to Wilson and other activists in 2015. &ldquo;They were deceived fair and simple,&rdquo; it <a href="https://policespiesoutoflives.org.uk/the-case-overview/text-of-apology-from-met-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a>. But the apology claimed that Kennedy was a rogue officer and that his superiors never would have authorized him to sleep with activists as an intelligence-gathering tactic. Wilson thought that was bogus. In a 2018 <em>Guardian </em>article <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2021/10/03/the-ruling-against-spycop-mark-kennedy-is-good-news-but-we-need-more-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>, &ldquo;I want to know how high up the police hierarchy knowledge of the abuses went.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></span></p></div><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1642458973699-katewilsontribunaloutsidecourt.jpeg?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Last September, after nearly 10 years of court battles, Kate Wilson won a tribunal case for breaches of her human rights.

Photo by Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images</p></div></div><p><span><p>After nearly 10 years of court battles, a legal authority known as the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled last September that Wilson had suffered grievous human rights abuses at the hands of Kennedy and the police apparatus that supported him. &ldquo;Senior officers either knew of the relationship, chose not to know of its existence, or were incompetent and negligent,&rdquo; the <a href="https://www.ipt-uk.com/judgments.asp?id=61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruling reads</a>. But the tribunal couldn&rsquo;t find evidence that the sexual relationships were a &ldquo;deliberate tactic&rdquo; of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. &ldquo;In our view, the true position is closer to being one of &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>It was still a monumental event. &ldquo;I am totally reeling,&rdquo; Wilson <a href="https://twitter.com/fruitbatmania/status/1443537956921294854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1443537956921294854%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecanary.co%2Fuk%2Fanalysis%2F2021%2F10%2F03%2Fthe-ruling-against-spycop-mark-kennedy-is-good-news-but-we-need-more-answers%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.&nbsp;</p></span><span><p>After decades of police secretly monitoring left-wing activists as if they were potential terrorists, the tribunal&rsquo;s judgment could <a href="https://sustainability.freshfields.com/post/102h7l7/specialist-human-rights-tribunal-gives-landmark-undercover-policing-judgment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put pressure on law enforcement</a> to actually respect the legitimate political expression of people who want to fix the planet and make society more equal. &ldquo;It is to be hoped that these events of some years ago are no longer features of policing in this country,&rdquo; the judgment reads. &ldquo;We hope the [police] will learn lessons from these proceedings.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>No matter what the tribunal decides in terms of damages, it&rsquo;s impossible to undo the harm Kennedy has already caused to Wilson and the global climate. The judgment in September noted that Wilson, now 41, &ldquo;has been cut off from a significant part of her political activity&rdquo; and that on the odd occasion when she&rsquo;s attended large political events, &ldquo;her anxiety has compelled her to leave.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;Up until this autumn, I was channelling all that passion for social change into fighting the police over this issue,&rdquo; Wilson said. &ldquo;Now, the court case is over and I need to figure out what happens next.&rdquo;</p></span><span><p>Halpin, too, says he was forced to &ldquo;withdraw from all climate-related protest&rdquo; due to fears about being tracked by police. What climate organizing he&rsquo;s able to do must take place at a higher political level, through <a href="https://progressive.international/council" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">groups like Progressive International</a>. In 2018, Halpin founded a company called Nym that uses blockchain technology to protect users from online surveillance.

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30240428" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div><article><p>Feb 6, 2022 &middot; 11 min read &middot; 0 views</p><p>I believe almost all first-time founders burn out their first employees as they learn how to manage groups of people. If this advice helps avoid a few cases, it's worth writing it down.</p>
<p>I wrote this article for managers of small teams/startups. I'd assume that most might not apply to management in larger enterprises. Btw <a href="https://klinger.io/posts/joining-hypergrowth-startups-%F0%9F%98%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> are my recommendations on joining hypergrowth companies in general.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I managed several small and midsized engineering teams&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>CTO at <a href="https://beondeck.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On Deck</a></li>
<li>prev VPE at CoinList
<ul>
<li>Head of Remote at AngelList&nbsp;</li>
<li>and CTO at Product Hunt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Let's get started.</h3>
<h4>As a manager, everything is your fault</h4>
<p>I know&hellip; very positive start &#128064;</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no point being angry at your team &ndash; ever</li>
<li>You are in charge of processes and people
<ul>
<li>And you got more information than they do, always</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You either created the processes where this outcome happened
<ul>
<li>or you hired (or did not fire) the wrong people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately everything is your fault</li>
</ul>
<h4>You manage processes; you lead people</h4>
<ul>
<li>For some reason, "managing people" means for many that they need to control people's work.
<ul>
<li>They end up micro-managing not only what when but also how people do their work.</li>
<li>If you got the time to micro-manage people, you can most likely hire cheaper, less talented people for your work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think it roots in a misunderstanding of what the role of a manager is:
<ul>
<li>your job is <em>not to manage people</em></li>
<li>but to <em>manage processes</em> and <em>lead people</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person's authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed</li>
<li>Additionally, you are leading people by example and through empathy.
<ul>
<li>They have goals, fears and motivations. Frequently also problems outside of work.</li>
<li>Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Processes are expectations made explicit</h4>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people make huge disclaimers around "processes."
<ul>
<li>"We don't want too many processes" etc
<ul>
<li>again, imho a misunderstanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Processes are not complex chains of people doing things that are burdened by horrible overheads
<ul>
<li><em>Processes are expectations made explicit</em>
<ul>
<li>They can be as simple as "every morning we all do X to ensure everyone else is unblocked."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have few but very explicit processes and expect them to be followed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decisions vs Opinions</h4>
<ul>
<li>In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions
<ul>
<li>&hellip;everyone else only adds opinions.</li>
<li>Ideally, the person who will afterward do (or lead) the follow-up work makes the decisions.
<ul>
<li>Everyone else just adds opinions.</li>
<li>This includes people of higher "rank" or pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Their manager have a <em>handbrake</em> they can use to hard-stop decisions.
<ul>
<li>Treat this as a literal handbrake.
<ul>
<li>Imagine a car driving, and you need to pull the handbrake because the car needs to stop, but the driver doesn't react. Damage will follow.</li>
<li>Pull the handbrake if absolutely needed and then discuss how to fix the situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire based on good decision-making skills
<ul>
<li>Fire based on poor decision-making skills
<ul>
<li>Good decision-making skills include listening to other people's opinions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case of doubt, see if you can trust the decision-maker by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ownership</h4>
<ul>
<li>It's hard to get people to own a problem space fully
<ul>
<li>But this is the goal
<ul>
<li>If they are the wrong person, you can still fire them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feedback them, help them
<ul>
<li>Trust them and let them make mistakes (within damage barriers)</li>
<li>Consider mistakes them leveling up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The worst thing that can happen is that you frequently step in, and people disassociate from their work
<ul>
<li>They become drones who do what's told instead of taking ownership.</li>
<li>If this is your goal, you can hire cheaper, less talented people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Avoid back and forth</h4>
<ul>
<li>When defining processes, avoid back and forth
<ul>
<li>Eg. if you give feedback on something assume that they will either do it or get back to you with reasons why not</li>
<li>Don't expect them to get your approval
<ul>
<li><em>Ain't nobody got time for that</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust</h4>
<ul>
<li>Always reflect if your nervousness is due to other people's work or your insecurity
<ul>
<li>Should other people have to handle your emotions for you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, it's easy to trust when things go well
<ul>
<li>The real challenge is when things go wrong</li>
<li>Always differ between your frustration about a situation and your frustration about a peson</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am not saying "stay out of it"
<ul>
<li>Stay in the loop, set expectations, voice opinions, but let them handle it. Use your handbrake if needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust through transparency</h4>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to have people trust your work is by transparently sharing it without request.
<ul>
<li>Have everything accessible where people would look for it</li>
<li>Don't make them ask for it, because most won't</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Trust is not binary</h4>
<ul>
<li>We tend to think of trust as binary
<ul>
<li>I either trust someone, or i don't</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But this isn't true
<ul>
<li>You trust different people with different things differently over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;Think of trust as something that you systemize
<ul>
<li>Eg what kind of trust do you give a new team member?
<ul>
<li>What are they expected to do in the first weeks? first month?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Don't confuse autonomy and abandonment</h4>
<ul>
<li>I frequently meet founders who hire people "and get out of their way"</li>
<li>While this is principle correct it doesn't absolve you from enabling them to succeed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decision Layering</h4>
<ul>
<li>Different people in the company on various levels rely on each other on doing their work.
<ul>
<li>A product manager can't do their job if the CEO doesn't know what their current priorities are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't load your work onto others in the company.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>And also avoid stepping into their work just because looks more fun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Avoid drive-by management</h4>
<ul>
<li>Don't start throwing your opinion or ideas around in meetings
<ul>
<li>You most likely lack context, and most likely, you won't be the person needing to follow through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it clear that it's just opinions and not decisions.
<ul>
<li>But know the power that the "opinion of the founder (or manager)" has towards most employees</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://klinger.io/posts/fyi-how-founders-can-avoid-drive-by-management" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fyi tags</a> in async communication that usually lacks the "nuance" of voice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Btw, I call it drive-by management because the manager comes by a group of people having a discussion. They throw requests, change mandates, and ideas around like bullets, create confusion, panic, chaos, and when they leave, they leave a bloody mess behind.</p>
<h4>Feedbacking people</h4>
<ul>
<li>people x context = output</li>
<li>I had great people in bad setups that had lousy output
<ul>
<li>I had very ordinary people in great setups that churned out more work than a whole team</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you feedback work, it's usually easier to discuss the context objectively than the person themselves
<ul>
<li>What is the situation that led to current problems?</li>
<li>What changed? What is currently required?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A junior engineer not keeping up with the work?
<ul>
<li>Is it their fault? Or is your team right now not able to support a junior learning the game?
<ul>
<li>This is ok, but should be either fixed or acknowledged (by discontinuing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A huge production incident happened?
<ul>
<li>How was this possible in the first place?
<ul>
<li>Where was the focus of the engineering team?</li>
<li>Was there a process in place to avoid it?</li>
<li>Should there be one?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The person breaking production isn't at fault here.
<ul>
<li>A whole team focused on other priorities</li>
<li>Was this for the right reasons? (eg release pressure?)
<ul>
<li>Or the wrong ones? (lacking sophistication?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always assume people you hired are motivated, and have the best intentions in mind
<ul>
<li>And fire the ones that don't</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Firing should never be a surprise</h4>
<ul>
<li>People should never be surprised that they are fired
<ul>
<li>Context changed, new requirements should have been communicated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you discontinue someone, you do it usually because of context
<ul>
<li>The company changed</li>
<li>The expectations of the role changed</li>
<li>You realized you looked for the wrong hiring criteria</li>
<li>It's most likely more your fault than theirs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They might have hoped that their new efforts were enough
<ul>
<li>But they will still understand when you fire them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Never delay firing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you decide to fire someone, do it.</li>
<li>Frequently people keep employees around in a zombie-like state
<ul>
<li>"We should discontinue them."</li>
<li>But you don't
<ul>
<li>It's not for them</li>
<li>They are most likely unhappy in their setup
<ul>
<li>Not appreciated</li>
<li>Not able to do good work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are most likely doing it for yourself
<ul>
<li>Because you are not feeling good about firing someone</li>
<li>They deserve better than you caring more about your feelings and future than theirs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up a call and discontinue them
<ul>
<li>Avoid any chitchat in the beginning</li>
<li>Start directly with the topic and have explicit clarity on the next steps
<ul>
<li>Make sure to communicate it as fact and truth</li>
<li>Remember that in this moment it's not about your feelings or problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then help them finding new roles</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explicit &gt; Implicit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clear decisions after meetings
<ul>
<li>No clear decision? Make that explicit too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear owners
<ul>
<li>No clear owner? Make that explicit too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hear everyone's opinions&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Make explicit who makes the decision</li>
<li>And what the decision is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<h4>Best practices: Start by making true what's real</h4>
<ul>
<li>When looking for best practices or changes in the team/processes, always look at first what already naturally emerged
<ul>
<li>If you hire good people they usually start looking for solutions naturally</li>
<li>Is this good? If yes make it explicit
<ul>
<li>"Make true what is real"</li>
</ul>

<li>If not discuss changing it</li>

<h4>Expect to refactor your company every few months</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fast-growing startups have to refactor how they operate internally every 3-6 months
<ul>
<li>So just go with the minimum changes you currently need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There will never be a final endstate
<ul>
<li>You will always be unhappy with processes in your company</li>
<li>You will have growing pains until you stagnate&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the same principles you'd use in refactoring code
<ul>
<li>Consider to&nbsp;

<h4>Burnout</h4>
<ul>
<li>It's a common misconception that burnouts come from hard work.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Burnout comes from a felt loss of control and/or impact.
<ul>
<li>Remember that you can burn out employees (or yourself) with little to no work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can you give people control over their impact?
<ul>
<li>How can you define boundaries around chaos around them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chaos is felt less by the people creating it</h4>
<ul>
<li>A common frustration of founders is that their team can't keep up with pivots.
<ul>
<li>As a founder, you most likely got more context on changes, you know earlier of them, and most importantly, you have control over them.</li>
<li>Employees don't.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Expect more from managers that report from you</h4>
<ul>
<li>By default, mistakes are not their team's fault but theirs
<ul>
<li>Share your honest opinions on things with them privately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, always give them the trust needed to make decisions</li>
<li>They are accountable for the outcomes
<ul>
<li>Responsible for all failures</li>
<li>But not responsible for the success
<ul>
<li>Success is the team's achievement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They should also, whenever possible, give spotlights to their team instead of taking it for themselves
<ul>
<li>The deal is simple: They get more authority, the team more ways to shine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The End of the Privacy of Digital Correspondence</h2>



<p>The EU wants to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content &ndash; generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. The result: Mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time messaging and chat control and the end of secrecy of digital correspondence. </p>



<p><strong>Chat control 2.0 coming up</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A majority of the Members of the European Parliament adopted the chatcontrol regulation</a> on 6 July 2021 allowing providers to scan communications voluntarily. So far only some unencrypted US services such as GMail, Meta/Facebook Messenger and X-Box apply chat control voluntarily. But this is not the end of the story: The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Fighting-child-sexual-abuse-detection-removal-and-reporting-of-illegal-content-online_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced that it will propose follow-up legislation that will make the use of chatcontrol&nbsp;<em>mandatory&nbsp;</em>for all e-mail and messenger providers</a>. This legislation will be presented an 2 March 2022 and would also apply to so far securely end-to-end encrypted communications services. However, a public consultation by the Commission demonstrated <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Child-sexual-abuse-online-detection-removal-and-reporting-/public-consultation_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that the majority of respondents, both citizens and stakeholders, were opposed to an obligation to use chat control.</a> Over 80% of respondents opposed its application to end-to-end encrypted communications. As a result, the Commission postponed the draft legislation to<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/api/files/SEC(2021)2387_0/090166e5dffa2f08?rendition=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a>Q1 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Protest now with the responsible EU Commissioners!</strong></p>



<p>Politely tell them your concerns about chat control (<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de#AdditionalInformation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguments below</a>). Experience shows that a phone call is more effective than e-mails or letters. Officially, the planned obligation for message and chat control is called &ldquo;legislation to effectively tackle child sexual abuse online&rdquo;. If authorities try to excuse themselves by saying that the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs (Directorate-General for Home Affairs) is responsible, point out that all EU Commissioners can vote on draft legislation and raise concerns at an early stage.</p>

<p>In 2020 the European Commission <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; legislation</a> aimed at allowing the search of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This is to allow the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process and using error-prone &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo;. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed automatically and without human verification to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>



<p>Some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls. Through a second piece of legislation, the EU Commission intends to oblige all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology. <strong><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">At the same time, a representative survey conducted in March 2021 clearly shows that a majority of Europeans oppose the use of chat control&nbsp;</a></strong><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> (</a><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Detailed poll results here)</a><strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">.</a></strong></p>

<h2>How does this affect you?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li><li>If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos</strong> may be viewed by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li><li><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for &ldquo;child grooming&rdquo; frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li><li><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated </strong>for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, 86% of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. 40% of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; target minors.</li><li>On your next <strong>trip overseas,</strong> you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy &ndash; with incalculable results.</li><li><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails. </strong>The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li><li><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li></ul>

<h3>Timeline</h3>



<p>The trilogue negotiations on the draft law, in which representatives of the European Parliament negotiate with EU governments with the participation of the EU Commission, were concluded in May. Voluntary chat control is coming! <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chat-control-home-affairs-committee-approves-regulation-on-indiscriminate-searching-of-private-communications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here is my press release on the outcome of the negotiations</a>. <strong>The final vote in the European Parliament is scheduled for 6 July.</strong></p>



<p>In March 2022 the EU Commission intends to make a second legislative proposal, which is to force all providers of email, messaging and chat services to comprehensively search all private messages in the absence of any suspicion.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications <strong>violates fundamental rights and is prohibited </strong>(paragraph 177). For this reason, Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has filed a complaint against U.S. companies Facebook and Google with the data protection authorities for violating the General Data Protection Regulation. Former judge of the European Court of Justice Prof. Dr. Ninon Colneric has extensively analysed the plans and <strong>concludes in a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legal assessment</a> that the EU legislative plans on chat control are not in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice and violate the fundamental rights of all EU citizens</strong> to respect for privacy, to data protection and to freedom of expression.</p>

However, experience has shown that individually worded messages are more effective.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Generate media attention! </strong>So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject &ndash; online and offline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers!</strong> Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<ul><li><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime. </strong>Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring &ndash; contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications. </strong>According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li><li><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed. </strong>Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/us/politics/edward-snowden-at-nsa-sexually-explicit-photos-often-shared.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past. A Google engineer has been <a href="https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> to stalk minors.</li><li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, 90% of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach.</li><li><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk. </strong>Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li><li><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized. </strong>In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li><li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates</strong>. Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or &ldquo;harmful content&rdquo;. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li><li><strong>The temporary legislation on the table is ineffective. </strong>Contrary to its intent, it will not allow Facebook et al to continue the mass monitoring of private correspondence. It does limit the ePrivacy directive. The chat control, however, will continue to violate the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) because it lacks a legal basis and violates the principle of proportionality. A complaint filed by Patrick Breyer is being examined by the Irish Data Protection Agency.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Why messaging and chat control harms children and abuse victims</strong></h2>



<p>Proponents claim indiscriminate messaging and chat control facilitates the prosecution of child sexual exploitation. However, this argument is controversial, even among victims of child sexual abuse. In fact messaging and chat control can hurt victims and potential victims of sexual exploitation:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Safe spaces are destroyed. </strong>Victims of sexual violence are especially in need of the ability to communicate safely and confidentially to seek counseling and support, for example to safely exchange among each other, with their therapists or attorneys. The introduction of real-time monitoring takes these safe rooms away from them. This can discourage victims from seeking help and support.</li><li><strong>Self-recorded nude photos of minors (sexting) end up in the hands of company employees</strong> and police where they do not belong and are not safe.</li><li><strong>Minors are being criminalized. </strong>Especially young people often share intimate recordings with each other (sexting). With messaging and chat control in place, their photos and videos may end up in the hands of criminal investigators. German crime statistics demonstrate that 40% of all investigations for child pornography target minors.</li><li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the circulation of illegal material but </strong><strong>actually makes it more difficult to prosecute child sexual exploitation. </strong>It encourages offenders to go underground and use private encrypted servers which can be impossible to detect and intercept. Even on open channels, indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the volume of material circulated, as evidenced by the constantly rising number of machine reports.</li></ol>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As an abuse survivor, I (and millions of other survivors across the world) rely on confidential communications to both find support and report the crimes against us &ndash; to remove our rights to privacy and confidentiality is to subject us to further injury and frankly, we have suffered enough. [&hellip;] it doesn&rsquo;t matter what steps we take to find abusers, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many freedoms or constitutional rights we destroy in order to meet that agenda &ndash; it WILL NOT stop children from being abused, it will simply push the abuse further underground, make it more and more difficult to detect and ultimately lead to more children being abused as the end result.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&bdquo;the assessment of child abuse-related facts is part of the legal profession&rsquo;s area of responsibility. Accordingly, the communication exchanged between lawyers and clients will often contain relevant keywords.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A blanket and unprovoked monitoring of digital communication channels is neither proportionate nor necessary to detect online child abuse.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As with other types of content scanning (whether on platforms like YouTube or in private communications) scanning everything from everyone all the time creates huge risks of leading to mass surveillance by failing the necessity and proportionality test.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The DAV is explicitly in favour of combating the preparation and commission of child sexual abuse and its dissemination via the internet through effective measures at EU-level. However, the Interim Regulation proposed by the Commission would allow blatantly disproportionate infringements on the fundamental rights of users of internet-based communication services. Furthermore, the proposed Interim Regulation lacks sufficient procedural safeguards for those affected. This is why the legislative proposal should be rejected as a whole.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Positive hits with subsequent disclosure to governmental and non-governmental agencies would be feared not only by accused persons but above all by victims of child sexual abuse. In this context, the absolute confidentiality of legal counselling is indispensable in the interest of the victims, especially in these matters which are often fraught with shame. In these cases in particular, the client must retain the authority to decide which contents of the mandate may be disclosed to whom.

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the course of the initiative &ldquo;Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content&rdquo;, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy [&hellip;]. The initiative would also severely harm Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Experts from the police and academia are rather critical of the EU&rsquo;s plan: on the one hand, they fear many false reports by the scanners, and on the other hand, an alibi function of the law. Daniel Kretzschmar, spokesman for the Federal Board of the Association of German Criminal Investigators, says that the fight against child abuse depictions is &ldquo;enormously important&rdquo; to his association. Nevertheless, he is skeptical: unsuspected persons could easily become the focus of investigations. At the same time, he says, privatizing these initiative investigations means &ldquo;making law enforcement dependent on these companies, which is actually a state and sovereign task. &ldquo;</p><p>Thomas-Gabriel R&uuml;diger, head of the Institute for Cybercriminology at the Brandenburg Police University, is also rather critical of the EU project. &ldquo;In the end, it will probably mainly hit minors again,&rdquo; he told WELT. R&uuml;diger refers to figures from the crime statistics, according to which 43 percent of the recorded crimes in the area of child pornographic content would be traced back to children and adolescents themselves. This is the case, for example, with so-called &ldquo;sexting&rdquo; and &ldquo;schoolyard pornography &ldquo;, when 13- and 14-year-olds send each other lewd pictures.</p><p>Real perpetrators, who you actually want to catch, would probably rather not be caught. &ldquo;They are aware of what they have done and use alternatives. Presumably, USB sticks and other data carriers will then be increasingly used again,&rdquo; R&uuml;diger continues.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Federal investigators served Google with a geofence warrant as part of an investigation into an attempted arson against a police union headquarters in Seattle during protests of the shooting of Jacob Blake, as shown by documents unsealed today in federal court. </p>
<p>The attempted arson took place on August 24th, 2020, one day after police officers shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, leaving him paralyzed. Amidst broader protests in Seattle and across the country, two people threw Molotov cocktails at the rear entrance of the headquarters of the Seattle Police Officers Guild (SPOG).</p>
<p>While the building sustained little damage, the attack spurred widespread national interest: Seattle police initially posted a $1,000 reward for information, and the FBI later <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/seattle/news/press-releases/fbi-offers-20000-reward-for-information-on-arson-and-possession-of-a-destructive-device" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered up to $20,000</a> for any tips that would help identify the people involved.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21197805-seattle-fbi-geofence-warrant-oct-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documents unsealed on February 3rd</a> show that, before offering the reward for information, the FBI also used a controversial search technique known as a geofence warrant to request information from Google about all Android devices that had passed through the area before and after the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On August 24, 2020, at approximately 11:00 p.m., two unknown suspects intentionally damaged the SPOG building using what I believe to be improvised incendiary devices,&rdquo; an FBI agent told the court in the affidavit. &ldquo;Based on the foregoing, I submit that there is probable cause to search information that is currently in the possession of Google and that relates to the devices that reported being within the Target Location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warrant is addressed to Google and requests &ldquo;Location History data, sourced from information including GPS data and information about visible wi-fi points and Bluetooth beacons transmitted from devices to Google, reflecting devices that Google calculated were or could have been ... located within the geographical region bounded by the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, dates, and times below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geographical coordinates provided with the warrant cover an area of a block that contains the police guild building and various other businesses and also includes all four street intersections at the edge of the block. The timeframe of the warrant begins at 10PM PT and extends till 11:15PM.</p>

<p>The nature of such a warrant means that any Android user passing through the area during that hour would have their information disclosed to the FBI by Google.</p>
<p>Generally, when geofence warrants are issued, Google returns an anonymized list of devices that were present in the defined area over the given time period. If any of these devices seem to belong to suspects in the case, investigators may ask Google to release more information.</p>
<p>Court records show Google complied with the warrant, as it was returned as executed the following day. However, the fact that a public appeal for information was made by the FBI months after the warrant was granted suggests that any information provided by Google did not help with the investigation. </p>
<p>&ldquo;As with all law enforcement requests, we have a rigorous process that is designed to protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement,&rdquo; a Google spokesperson said.</p>
<p>A press request sent to the FBI&rsquo;s Seattle field office had not received a response by time of publication, and a spokesperson for the Seattle Police Department said she was not immediately able to comment on technical details of the investigation.</p>
<p>While some towns saw significant property damage in the wake of the Jacob Blake protests, all evidence shows the attack against the Seattle union building was ineffective and notable mostly as an affront to local police. Surveillance footage <a href="https://mynorthwest.com/2117542/rantz-video-shows-activists-launching-molotov-cocktails-at-seattle-police-union-building/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released by police</a> shows two people running into the parking lot of the SPOG building and launching the flaming projectiles at the building. The video appears to show one of the Molotov cocktails extinguishing soon after being thrown while another bursts above an outdoor stairwell.</p>
<p>The use of geofence warrants has grown rapidly across the US in recent years, with data released by Google <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/geofence-warrants-google/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showing a dramatic spike from 2018 to 2020</a>. According to Google&rsquo;s transparency report, the company received 11,554 of these warrants in 2020 compared to only 982 in 2018.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time authorities have used geofence warrants in response to a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest. Separately to the Seattle case described above, six separate warrants were issued in Kenosha, Wisconsin to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644965/kenosha-protests-geofence-warrants-atf-android-data-police-jacob-blake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collect information on devices in proximity to protest areas</a> after the shooting of Jacob Blake.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>I created a heavily-commented AES/Rijndael implementation to go along with this post and <a href="http://github.com/moserware/AES-Illustrated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put it on GitHub</a>. In keeping with the Foot-Shooting Prevention Agreement, it shouldn&rsquo;t be used for production code, but it should be helpful in seeing exactly where all the numbers came from in this play. Several resources were useful in creating this:</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29932099" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div>
            <p><em>This article originally appeared in Episodes, our newsletter. If you'd like insights on workflow and craft (like these) in your inbox every two weeks, you can </em><a href="https://www.descript.com/blog/article/jad-abumrads-workflow-5-steps-to-better-storytelling#subscribe-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>
            <p>Nobody spins a better yarn than Jad Abumrad. At <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiolab</a>, <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolabmoreperfect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More Perfect</a>, and <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolly Parton&rsquo;s America</a>, he&rsquo;s told as many memorable audio stories as any living creator.</p>
            <p>On all of those projects, Jad weaves complex, nuanced, often surprising narratives. That&rsquo;s what makes them so interesting. What makes them so affecting is the way each one cuts through the complexity to zero in on a fundamental, profound truth.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s not easy though. Jad acknowledged as much in a conversation with the winners of our Studio Sound contest (held in October, to see who could show the most impressive, creative uses of Studio Sound). Mark Oppenheimer, creator and producer of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/constitutional-landmarks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Constitutional Landmarks</a> podcast, asked for Jad&rsquo;s advice on how to construct a tight narrative when you've got hours of recorded interviews.</p>
            <p>His five-minute answer was basically a master class in workflow for storytellers. Even if you&rsquo;re not telling the kind of big, unwieldy, profound stories Jad tells, or doing 5+ interviews per story, you'll want to read this<br></p>
          </div><div>
            <h2>A storyteller's workflow </h2>
            <p><strong>Step 1: Listen.</strong> To prepare himself to listen to the tape (all the interviews he's recorded) Jad finds a comfortable chair and tries to get himself into something akin to &ldquo;a meditative mindset&rdquo; where he&rsquo;s open to and aware of anything that makes him react. That could be something that strikes him as odd, or surprising, or that makes him sit up and lean in, wondering what&rsquo;s coming next. Or just a nice turn of phrase or an eloquent description of something important. What we take from this: don&rsquo;t try to <em>listen for </em>anything. Just listen. See what grabs you.<br></p>
            <p><strong>Step 2: Clip to composition.</strong> Alright, we made it this far without talking about Descript. But now we have to because it&rsquo;s what Jad uses to collect the moments that jump out at him during his almost-meditative listening. In the transcript view, he highlights (probably by pressing &#8984;&#8679;H) the part that just caught his attention or caused a reaction; then he clips it to a new composition (using &#8984;C, I&rsquo;ll bet) where he&rsquo;s collecting all those moments. When he&rsquo;s done listening to all the raw recordings, he&rsquo;ll listen to the new composition, which is now a distillation of all the most resonant moments he&rsquo;s captured. <em>[Note: you too can </em><a href="https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042209972-Copy-Highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>copy highlights</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042639071-Clip-to-Composition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>clip to composition</em></a><em>]</em><br></p>
            <p><strong>Step 3: Tell a friend.</strong> Jad listens to the best-of composition a few times himself, to get a sense of the story. Then he walks away from it, finds someone who knows nothing about it, and tells them the story himself, in his own words. As they listen, he's taking note of the moments where their eyes get wide, they lean in, or otherwise engage&mdash;and the moments where they lose the thread. Jad calls this a &ldquo;physical kinetic act of telling the story to see what works.&rdquo; So you want to be in the room with the person, or at least on Zoom or somewhere you can see them.<br></p>
            <p><strong>Step 4. Summary + First cut.</strong> Based on what he observed from whoever he told the story to, Jad writes up a quick summary; it's like a treatment, or an abstract&mdash;just two or three paragraphs that lay out what happened, describe the important inflection points, where he&rsquo;ll bring in quotes, and from whom. Then he pulls together all the corresponding clips to make a very rough audio version of the summary. This is generally still 4-5 times longer than the final cut will be.<br></p>
            <p><strong>Step 5. Ask the tape.</strong> Here&rsquo;s where it gets mystical. Once Jad has his assembled his rough version, he asks himself, &ldquo;does the tape like this?&rdquo; If the tape doesn&rsquo;t like the way he&rsquo;s laid it out, he&rsquo;ll get in and start shifting things around&mdash;editing the recordings or adjusting the narrative until the tape is in the right order, until the tape says, in Jad's words &ldquo;I like this!&rdquo;<br></p>
            <p>Now obviously the tape isn&rsquo;t going to actually talk to you&mdash;it only talks to Jad. But hopefully you get the idea: the material you&rsquo;ve recorded may not always fall neatly into the story you have in your head, or on paper. Maybe an interviewee never explicitly says the big thing you took away from their interview, so you have to find a different way to get that point across. That's why you ask the tape.<strong>&zwj;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Step 6. Edit.</strong> Only now, after all of this, does Jad dive into editing. This is crucial. Before you start splicing clips together, adding fades, removing filler words, and so on, you want to have your <em>story</em> locked down.<br></p>
            <p>This is also the part that applies to every creator, whether you&rsquo;re doing narrative journalism, a topical monologue, a seat-of-the-pants interview show, whatever. <strong>Don&rsquo;t start the technical editing until you&rsquo;ve got the content squared away</strong>. Jad learned this the hard way. &ldquo;I used to just jump in the tape and start editing,&rdquo; he told our contest winners. &ldquo;And I would try to edit my way out, and I would get so lost.&rdquo;<br></p>
            <p>You may not have enough material to get lost in. But you almost certainly have enough to drive yourself to madness if you keep running into narrative dead-ends. And you probably don&rsquo;t have much time to spare. Most creators are pushing themselves to exhaustion just trying to finish what they started, and to make something they can feel good about.<br></p>
            <p>So take whatever you can from Jad&rsquo;s advice. We hope it helps you work faster, or smarter, or both.<br></p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29955893" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div>

	<div><p><span>The UK government is set to launch a multi-pronged publicity attack on end-to-end encryption, <em>Rolling Stone</em> has learned. One key objective: mobilizing public opinion against <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/facebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&rsquo;s decision to encrypt its Messenger app.</span></p>
<p><span>The Home Office has hired the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency &mdash; a spin-off of Saatchi and Saatchi, which made the &ldquo;Labour Isn&rsquo;t Working&rdquo; election posters, among the most famous in UK political history &mdash; to plan the campaign, using public funds.</span></p>
<p><span>According to documents reviewed by <em>Rolling Stone</em>, one the activities considered as part of the publicity offensive is a striking stunt &mdash; placing an adult and child (both actors) in a glass box, with the adult looking &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; at the child as the glass fades to black. Multiple sources confirmed the campaign was due to start this month, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">privacy</a> groups already planning a counter-campaign.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>&ldquo;We have engaged M&amp;C Saatchi to bring together the many organisations who share our concerns about the impact end-to-end encryption would have on our ability to keep children safe,&rdquo; a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement.</span></p>


<p><span>Successive Home Secretaries of different political parties have taken strong anti-encryption stances, claiming the technology &mdash; which is essential for online privacy and security &mdash; will diminish the effectiveness of UK bulk surveillance capabilities, make fighting organized crime more difficult, and hamper the ability to stop terror attacks. The American FBI has made similar arguments in recent years &mdash; claims which have been widely debunked by technologists and civil libertarians on both sides of the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span>The new campaign, however, is entirely focused on the argument that improved encryption would hamper efforts to tackle child exploitation online. A presentation attributed to M&amp;C Saatchi notes that &ldquo;some messaging platforms, including WhatsApp&rdquo; already use end-to-end encryption, but want to oppose its extension.</span></p>
<p><span>The plans include a media blitz, campaign efforts from UK charities and law enforcement agencies, calls to action for the public to contact tech companies directly, and multiple real-world stunts &mdash; some designed to make the public &ldquo;uneasy.&rdquo; The presentation was produced to recruit potential not-for-profit coalition partners, so it is not clear whether or not each proposed action within was approved for the final campaign.</span></p>
<p><span>One key slide notes that &ldquo;most of the public have never heard&rdquo; of end-to-end encryption &ndash; adding that this means &ldquo;people can be easily swayed&rdquo; on the issue. The same slide notes that the campaign &ldquo;must not start a privacy vs safety debate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Online advocates slammed the UK government plans as &ldquo;scaremongering&rdquo; that could put children and vulnerable adults at risk by undermining online privacy.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The Home Office&rsquo;s scaremongering campaign is as disingenuous as it is dangerous,&rdquo; said Robin Wilton, director of Internet Trust at the Internet Society. &ldquo;Without strong encryption, children are more vulnerable online than ever. Encryption protects personal safety and national security &hellip; what the government is proposing puts everyone at risk.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to a Freedom of Information request about an &ldquo;</span><a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/790066/response/1894179/attach/html/3/65966%20Andrew%20Poelstra%20final%20response.pdf.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>upcoming ad campaign directed at Facebook&rsquo;s end-to-end encryption proposal</span></a><span>,&rdquo; The Home Office disclosed that, &ldquo;Under current plans, c.&pound;534,000 is allocated for this campaign.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Requests for comment to the Home Office and to M&amp;C Saatchi were not immediately returned. A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, one of the campaign partners mentioned in the presentation, told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, &ldquo;This would be best directed to the Home Office press office I believe.&rdquo;</span></p>


<p><span>The opening phase of the campaign is expected to launch within days. According to the presentation, the push will appear to be&nbsp; the result of grassroots action and children&rsquo;s charities, while downplaying any government role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;For the day of launch,&rdquo; the presentation notes &ldquo;we will publish a press notice announcing that the UK&rsquo;s biggest children&rsquo;s charity and stakeholders have come together to urge social media companies to put children&rsquo;s safety first.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This campaign would be targeted through an &ldquo;agreed list of media outlets&rdquo;, including &ldquo;sofa programmes&rdquo; such as Loose Women and This Morning for broadcast. The slide notes the project is &ldquo;exploring a partnership&rdquo; with the tabloid newspaper The Sun &mdash; the UK&rsquo;s second-best selling newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span>This launch will, the presentation states, be accompanied by a digital counter in a public space, counting up to 14 million over the course of 24 hours &mdash; the number of incidents of potential exploitation the government believes could be missed as a result of expanded end-to-end encryption.</span></p>
<p><span>The Home Office has faced previous scrutiny over its behind-the-scenes roles in communications plans. It has run operations aimed at countering extremism and polarization, criticized by investigative journalist Ian Cobain for </span><a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/mind-control-secret-british-government-blueprints-shaping-post-terror-planning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>hiding the government role</span></a><span> in the apparently spontaneous showing of solidarity by minority groups after terror attacks, for example.</span></p>
<p><span>The new campaign is likely to trigger similar concerns, especially as M&amp;C Saatchi proposed several methods to get the public to engage directly with social media companies.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;[W]e are exploring a number of activations which would prompt action from both the coalition and the public &hellip; There is scope for this to involve a social media activation where we ask parents to write to Mark [Zuckerberg] via their Facebook status.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most striking and unsettling action is planned for this stage, which M&amp;C Saatchi states &ldquo;will create a visual PR stunt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;A glass box is installed in a public space,&rdquo; the presentation notes. &ldquo;Inside the box, there are two actors; one child and one adult. Both strangers. The child sits playing on their smart phone. At the other end of the box, we see an adult sat on a chair also on their phone, typing away.</span></p>


<p><span>&ldquo;The adult occasionally looks over at the child, knowingly. Intermittently through the day, the &lsquo;privacy glass&rsquo; will turn on and the previously transparent glass box will become opaque. Passers by won&rsquo;t be able to see what&rsquo;s happening inside. In other words, we create a sense of unease by hiding what the child and adult are doing online when their interaction can&rsquo;t be seen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>One key aim of the exercise would, the document noted, be to &ldquo;force Facebook to evaluate their sense of responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>End-to-end encryption is already built into many major messaging apps: WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) uses it by default, as does Apple&rsquo;s iMessage, as well as independent apps like Signal and Telegram.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Facebook has been planning to extend this default to its Messenger app &mdash; which appears to have become a major focus of UK anti-encryption efforts. The plan also involves making personal appeals to Facebook&rsquo;s founder, targeting him &ldquo;as a father, not as a businessman.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The letter will &ldquo;outline the concerns of parents by sharing new sentiment gained from phase 1&rdquo;, and considers getting a spokesperson to turn up with a copy of the letter to Facebook&rsquo;s headquarters in London &ndash; suggesting they could ask to &ldquo;speak to Mark.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The UK government has been among the most strident in the democratic world in its opposition to end-to-end encryption &mdash; to an extent that has prompted a backlash even among some former senior security officials.</span></p>
<p><span>In a lecture last November, former chief executive of the UK&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre Ciaran Martin criticized the Home Office&rsquo;s rhetoric on encryption &mdash; and its broader approach.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;As well as choosing language designed to inflame even the most moderate opponent, this framing was also technically ridiculous. There was no proposal to &ldquo;break&rdquo; this near-unbreakable encryption, which hasn&rsquo;t even been implemented yet by Facebook,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In other words, the policy is technological &lsquo;cakeism&rsquo;&mdash; the government is trying to eat its lawful access cake while having end-to-end encrypted protection for citizens more generally &hellip; Most experts are highly doubtful, and believe the government is searching for the digital equivalent of alchemy.&rdquo;</span></p>

The unprecedented finding from the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) targets what privacy experts are calling a &ldquo;big data ark&rdquo; containing billions of<strong> </strong>points of information. Sensitive data in the ark has been drawn from crime reports, hacked from encrypted phone services and sampled from asylum seekers never involved in any crime.</span></p><p>According to internal documents seen by the Guardian, Europol&rsquo;s cache contains at least 4 petabytes &ndash; equivalent to 3m CD-Roms or a fifth of the entire contents of the US Library of Congress. Data protection advocates say the volume of information held on Europol&rsquo;s systems amounts to mass surveillance and is a step on its road to becoming a European counterpart to the US National Security Agency (NSA), the organisation whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clandestine online spying was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden</a>.</p><p>Among the quadrillions of bytes held are sensitive data on at least a quarter of a million current or former terror and serious crime suspects and a multitude of other people with whom they came into contact. It has been accumulated from national police authorities over the last six years, in a series of data dumps from an unknown number of criminal investigations.</p><p>The watchdog ordered Europol to erase data held for more than six months and gave it a year to sort out what could be lawfully kept.</p><p>The confrontation pits the EU data protection watchdog against a powerful security agency being primed to become the centre of machine learning and AI in policing.</p><p>The ruling also exposes deep political divisions among Europe&rsquo;s decision-makerson the trade-offs between security and privacy. The eventual outcome of their face-off has implications for the future of privacy in Europe and beyond.</p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(min-width: 980px) and

with the &lsquo;herculean task&rsquo; of analysing lawfully transmitted data.</span> Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson appeared to defend Europol. &ldquo;Law enforcement authorities need the tools, resources and the time to analyse data that is lawfully transmitted to them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In Europe, Europol is the platform that supports national police authorities with this herculean task.&rdquo;</p><p>The commission says the legal concerns raised by the EDPS raise &ldquo;a serious challenge&rdquo; for Europol&rsquo;s ability to fulfil its duties. Last year, it proposed sweeping changes to the regulation underpinning Europol&rsquo;s powers. If made law, the proposals could in effect retrospectively legalise the data cache and preserve its contents as a testing ground for new AI and machine learning tools.</p><p>Europol denies any wrongdoing, and said the watchdog may be interpreting the current rules in an impractical way: &ldquo;[The] Europol regulation was not intended by the legislator as a requirement which is impossible to be met by the data controller [ie Europol] in practice.&rdquo;</p><p>Europol had worked with the EDPS &ldquo;to find a balance between keeping the EU secure and its citizens safe while adhering to the highest standards of data protection&rdquo;, the agency said.</p><p>Founded as a coordinating body for national police forces in the EU and headquartered in The Hague, Europol has been pushed by some member states as a solution to terrorism concerns in the wake of the 2015 Bataclan attacks and encouraged to harvest data on multiple fronts.</p><figure><div><picture

Europol is subject to tight regulation over what kinds of personal data it can store and for how long. Incoming records are meant to be strictly categorised and only processed or retained when they have potential relevance to high-value work such as counter-terrorism. But the full contents of what it holds are unknown, in part because of the haphazard way that EDPS found Europol to be treating data.</p><hr><p><span><span>O</span></span><span>nly a handful of Europeans have become aware that their own data is being stored and none is known to have been able to force disclosure. Frank van der Linde, who was placed on a terror watchlist in his native Netherlands and later removed, is one of the rare visible threads in an otherwise unseen mesh.</span></p><p>The political activist, whose only serious run-ins with police amount to breaking a window to gain entrance to a building and create a squat for homeless people, was removed from the Dutch watchlist by authorities in 2019. But a year prior to this removal he had moved to Berlin, which unknown to Van der Linde at the time prompted Dutch police to share his data with German counterparts and Europol. The activist discovered his entanglement with Europol only when he saw a partially declassified file at Amsterdam city hall.</p><p>To get his personal data removed from any international databases he turned to Europol. He was surprised when in June 2020 it responded saying it had nothing he was &ldquo;entitled to have access to&rdquo;. The activist took his complaint to the EDPS. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they deleted the data after Dutch authorities updated them [that] they don&rsquo;t consider me an extremist &hellip; Europol is a black box.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The ease of getting on such a list is horrific,&rdquo; Van der Linde said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shocking how easily police share information over borders, and it&rsquo;s terrifying how difficult it is to manage to delete yourself from these lists.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><span><span>C</span></span><span>oncerns over Europol&rsquo;s treatment of sensitive data prompted the watchdog to raise its own questions in 2019. Its initial findings in September of that year showed that data sets shared with Europol were stored without the proper checks to verify whether people scooped up in them ought to be monitored or their data retained. Access to the ark is restricted to authorised personnel and a lot of its content has been examined, cleansed and used legally.</span></p><p>When Europol failed to convincingly answer the watchdog&rsquo;s concerns, the EDPS <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/investigations/edps-decision-own-initiative-inquiry-europols_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publicly admonished</a> the police agency in September 2020 making clear what was at stake: &ldquo;Data subjects run the risk of wrongfully being linked to a criminal activity across the EU, with all of the potential damage for their personal and family life, freedom of movement and occupation that this entails.&rdquo;</p><p>The tussle that followed is captured in a series of internal documents obtained under freedom of information laws. They show Europol stalling for time and the watchdog telling them that they have failed to resolve &ldquo;the legal breach&rdquo;. The police agency appears to be holding out for new EU legislation to provide retrospective cover for what it has been doing without a legal basis for six years.</p><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s nervousness over a public clash was enough to pull Monique Pariat, the EU&rsquo;s director general for home affairs, into a meeting between the two agencies in December 2021. Sources said the watchdog had been encouraged to &ldquo;tone down&rdquo; its public criticism of Europol.</p><p>But the head of EDPS, Wojciech Wiewi&oacute;rowski, told the Guardian that the meeting was &ldquo;the last moment for Europol to add some information that wasn&rsquo;t added in their last replies to our letter&rdquo;.</p><p>As the meeting did nothing to answer Wiewi&oacute;rowski&rsquo;s concerns on lawful retention of data &ldquo;there was no other way to solve the problem, for us&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than to issue a decision to erase the data which is over six months&rdquo;.</p><p>Niovi Vavoula, a legal expert at Queen Mary University of London, said: &ldquo;The new legislation is actually an effort to game the system. Europol and the commission have been attempting an ex-post rectification of illegally retaining data for years. But putting new rules in place does not legally resolve previously illegal conduct. This is not how the rule of law works.&rdquo;</p><p>Experts&rsquo; concerns are not confined to Europol&rsquo;s flouting of rules on data retention. They also see a law enforcement agency that aspires to conduct mass surveillance operations.</p><p>Members of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee of the European parliament during a hearing in June 2021 compared the agency to the NSA. Wiewi&oacute;rowski surprised attenders by endorsing the comparison in relation to Europol&rsquo;s practice of retaining data. He pointed out that Europol was using similar arguments to those used by the NSA to defend bulk data collection operations and mass surveillance as revealed by Snowden.</p><p>&ldquo;What the NSA said to Europeans after the Prism scandal started was that they are not processing the data, they are just collecting it and they will process it only in case it is necessary for the investigation they are doing,&rdquo; <a href="https://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/webstreaming/libe-committee-meeting_20210616-0900-COMMITTEE-LIBE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wiewi&oacute;rowski told MEPs</a>. &ldquo;This is something that doesn&rsquo;t comply with the European approach to processing personal data.&rdquo;</p><p>Eric Topfer, a surveillance expert at the German Institute for Human Rights, has studied the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0796" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed new Europol regulation</a> and said it foresees the agency pulling in data directly from banks, airlines, private companies and emails. &ldquo;If Europol will only have to ask for certain kinds of information to have them served on a silver platter, then we are moving closer to having an NSA-like agency.&rdquo;</p><hr><p><span><span>T</span></span><span>he struggle with EDPS over data storage is the latest evidence of Europol favouring technosolutions to security concerns over privacy rights. Europol&rsquo;s boss, previously Belgium&rsquo;s top cop, co-wrote an<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-last-refuge-of-the-criminal-encrypted-smartphones-data-privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> op-ed </a>in July 2021 which argued that the needs of law enforcement agencies to extract evidence from smartphones should trump privacy considerations. The article argues for a legal right to the keys to all encryption services.</span></p><p>No mention was made of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pegasus spyware revelations</a> that showed that many governments, including some in Europe, were actively attempting to intercept the communications of human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers for whom encryption offers their only protection.</p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(min-width: 980px) and

href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/dismantling-of-encrypted-network-sends-shockwaves-through-organised-crime-groups-across-europe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trumpeted</a> its involvement together with French and Dutch police in hacking the encrypted phone service EncroChat, unleashing a torrent of personal data into the ark. When the secret operation was revealed by Europol and its judicial counterpart, Eurojust, it was hailed as one of the biggest successes in battling organised crime in Europe&rsquo;s history. In the UK alone, about 2,600 people were taken into custody by August 2021 and Nikki Holland, the director of investigations at the UK National Crime Agency, compared the hack to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/02/blow-for-uk-organised-as-command-and-control-network-is-hit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;having an inside person in every top organised crime group in the country</a>&rdquo;. </p><p>Europol copied the data extracted from 120m EncroChat messages and tens of millions of call recordings, pictures and notes, then parcelled it out to national police forces. The flood of evidence of drug trafficking and other offences drowned out qualms about the implications of the operation. The hacking operation that turned EncroChat phones into mobile spies acting against their users has important similarities with surveillance malware such as Pegasus.</p><p>Lawyers from Germany, France, Sweden, Ireland, the UK, Norway and the Netherlands, all representing clients caught up in the aftermath, met in Utrecht in November 2021. They found that cases were being built across Europe based on evidence of which authorities were unwilling to reveal the provenance. &ldquo;Investigators and prosecutors were hiding or deforming the facts,&rdquo; said the German attorney Christian L&ouml;dden. &ldquo;We all agree that these are not the best people in the world, but what are we ready to sacrifice in order to convict one more person?&rdquo;</p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"

The Dutch attorney Haroon Raza was one of them and said he bought an EncroChat handset at a phone shop in Rotterdam. He demanded that his data be erased. &ldquo;As far as I could understand, a copy still lies in Europol&rsquo;s databases where it could remain forever.&rdquo;</p><p>French lawyer Robin Binsard is convinced that the whole operation amounts to mass surveillance. He said: &ldquo;Dismantling a whole communication system is like the police searching all the apartments in a block to find the proof of a crime: it violates privacy and it&rsquo;s simply illegal.&rdquo;</p><p>Since 2016, Europol has also been running a mass screening programme in refugee camps in Italy and Greece, sweeping up data from tens of thousands of asylum seekers in search of alleged foreign fighters and terrorists. According to a partially declassified EDPS inspection report obtained under freedom of information laws, &ldquo;routine checks&rdquo; by Europol of migrants crossing EU borders &ldquo;are not allowed&rdquo; as there is &ldquo;no legal basis&rdquo; for such a programme. The screening may have resulted in migrants&rsquo; personal data being stored on a criminal database regardless of any links being found to crime or terrorism. Europol has declined to reveal any operational details.</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span><span>nternal documents make clear that by spring 2020 Europol was developing its own machine learning and AI programme, even as the EU data watchdog was snapping at its heels. Finding itself with a growing cache of data, the agency turned to algorithms to make sense of it all. A month after the data supervisor publicly admonished Europol, the agency came back with a question: if it wanted to train algorithms on the data it had already been admonished for retaining, could it start the data protection impact assessment process for this without EDPS oversight? </span></p><p>The request makes it clear that the algorithms, which included facial recognition tools, would not be designed nor used to retrieve sensitive data such as health status, ethnic background, sexual or political orientation, even though, as Europol admitted, such data would inevitably be processed by the tools: &ldquo;We recognise that the produced results will contain sensitive data and its processing will be in line with Europol Regulation.&rdquo; </p><p>When the watchdog did not provide the green light, Europol decided in effect to sideline the EDPS and go ahead regardless, confirming as much in a January 2021 letter. </p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(min-width:

<p>By David Swanson, World BEYOND War, January 5, 2022</p>
<p>Propaganda is most impactful when people don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s propaganda, and most decisive when it&rsquo;s censorship you never knew happened. When we imagine that the U.S. military only occasionally and slightly influences U.S. movies, we are extremely badly deceived. The actual impact is on thousands of movies made, and thousands of others never made. And television shows of every variety. The military guests and celebrations of the U.S. military on game shows and cooking shows are no more spontaneous or civilian in origin than the ceremonies glorifying members of the U.S. military at professional sports games &mdash; ceremonies that have been paid for and choreographed by U.S. tax dollars and the U.S. military. The &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; content carefully shaped by the &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; offices of the Pentagon and the CIA doesn&rsquo;t just insidiously prepare people to react differently to news about war and peace in the world. To a huge extent it substitutes a different reality for people who learn very little actual news about the world at all.</p>
<p>The U.S. military knows that few people watch boring and non-credible news programs, much less read boring and non-credible newspapers, but that great masses will eagerly watch long movies and TV shows without too much worrying about whether anything makes sense. We know that the Pentagon knows this, and what military officials scheme and plot as a result of knowing this, because of the work of relentless researchers making use of the Freedom of Information Act. These researchers have obtained many thousands of pages of memos, notes, and script re-writes. I don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;ve put all of these documents online &mdash; I certainly hope they do and that they make the link widely available. I wish such a link were in giant font at the end of a fantastic new film. The film is called <em>Theaters of War: How the Pentagon and CIA Took Hollywood</em>. The Director, Editor, and Narrator is Roger Stahl. The Co-Producers are Matthew Alford, Tom Secker, Sebastian Kaempf. They&rsquo;ve provided an important public service.</p>
<p>In the film we see copies of and hear quotations from and analysis of much of what has been uncovered, and learn that thousands of pages exist that nobody has yet seen because the military has refused to produce them. Film producers sign contracts with the U.S. military or CIA. They agree to &ldquo;weave in key talking points.&rdquo; While unknown quantities of this sort of thing remain unknown, we do know that nearly 3,000 films and many thousands of TV episodes have been given the Pentagon treatment, and many others have been handled by the CIA. In many film productions, the military effectively becomes a co-producer with veto power, in exchange for allowing the use of military bases, weapons, experts, and troops. The alternative is the denial of those things.</p>
<p>But the military is not as passive as this might suggest. It actively pitches new story ideas to movie and TV producers. It seeks out new ideas and new collaborators who might bring them to a theater or laptop near you. <em>Act of Valor</em> actually began life as a recruitment advertisement.</p>
<p>Of course, many movies are made without military assistance. Many of the best never wanted it. Many that wanted it and were denied, managed to get made anyway, sometimes at much greater expense without the U.S. tax dollars paying for the props. But a huge number of movies are made with the military. Sometimes the initial movie in a series is made with the military, and the remaining episodes voluntarily follow the military&rsquo;s line. Practices are normalized. The military sees huge value in this work, including for recruitment purposes.</p>
<p>The alliance between the military and Hollywood is the main reason that we have lots of big blockbuster movies on certain topics and few if any on others. Studios have written scripts and hired top actors for movies on things like Iran-Contra that have never seen the light of day because of a Pentagon rejection. So, nobody watches Iran-Contra movies for fun the way they might watch a Watergate movie for fun. So, very few people have any notions about Iran-Contra.</p>
<p>But with the reality of what the U.S. military does being so awful, what, you might wonder, are the good topics that do get lots of movies made about them? A lot are fantasy or distortion.<em> Black Hawk Down</em> turned reality (and a book it was &ldquo;based on&rdquo;) on its head, as did <em>Clear and Present Danger</em>. Some, like <em>Argo</em>, hunt for small stories within large ones. Scripts explicitly tell audiences that it doesn&rsquo;t matter who started a war for what, that the only thing that matters is the heroism of troops trying to survive or to rescue a soldier.</p>
<p>Yet, actual U.S. military veterans are often shut out and not consulted They often find movies rejected by the Pentagon as &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo; to be very realistic, and those created with Pentagon collaboration to be highly unrealistic. Of course, a huge number of military-influenced films are made about the U.S. military fighting space aliens and magical creatures &mdash; not, clearly, because it&rsquo;s believable but because it avoids reality. On the other hand, other military-influenced films shape people&rsquo;s views of targeted nations and dehumanize the humans living in certain places.</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t Look Up</em> is not mentioned in <em>Theaters of War</em>, and presumably had no military involvement (who knows?, certainly not the movie-watching public), yet it uses a standard military-culture idea (the need to blow up something coming from outerspace, which in reality the U.S. government would simply love to do and you could hardly stop them) as an analogy for the need to stop destroying the planet&rsquo;s climate (which you cannot easily get the U.S. government to remotely consider) and not one reviewer notices that the film is an equally good or bad analogy for the need to stop building nuclear weapons &mdash; because U.S. culture has had that need effectively excised.</p>
<p>The military has written policies on what it approves and disapproves. It disapproves depictions of failures and crimes, which eliminates much of reality. It rejects films about veteran suicide, racism in the military, sexual harassment and assault in the military. But it pretends to refuse to collaborate on films because they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;realistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, if you watch enough of what is produced with military involvement you&rsquo;ll imagine that using and surviving nuclear war is perfectly plausible. This goes back to the <a href="https://davidswanson.org/the-beginning-of-the-end/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original Pentagon-Hollywood invention</a> of myths about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and runs right up through military influence on <em>The Day After</em>, not to mention the transformation &mdash; paid for by people who throw a fit if their tax dollars help prevent someone freezing on the street &mdash; of <em>Godzilla</em> from a nuclear warning to the reverse. In the original script for the first <em>Iron Man</em> movie, the hero went up against the evil weapons dealers. The U.S. military rewrote it so that he was a heroic weapons dealer who explicitly argued for more military funding. Sequels stuck with that theme. The U.S. military advertised its weapons of choice in <em>Hulk,</em> <em>Superman, Fast and Furious,</em> and <em>Transformers</em>, the U.S. public effectively paying to push itself to support paying thousands of times more &mdash; for weapons it would otherwise have no interest in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Documentaries&rdquo; on the Discovery, History, and National Geographic channels are military-made commercials for weapons. &ldquo;Inside Combat Rescue&rdquo; on National Geographic is recruitment propaganda. <em>Captain Marvel</em> exists to sell the Air Force to women. Actress Jennifer Garner has made recruitment ads to accompany movies she&rsquo;s made that are themselves more effective recruitment ads. A movie called <em>The Recruit</em> was largely written by the head of the CIA&rsquo;s entertainment office. Shows like NCIS push out the military&rsquo;s line. But so do shows you wouldn&rsquo;t expect: &ldquo;reality&rdquo; TV shows, game shows, talk shows (with endless reunifications of family members), cooking shows, competition shows, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://davidswanson.org/eye/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">written before</a> about how <em>Eye in the Sky</em> was openly and proudly both completely unrealistic nonsense and influenced by the U.S. military to shape people&rsquo;s ideas about drone murders. A lot of people have some small idea of what goes on. But <em>Theaters of War: How the Pentagon and CIA Took Hollywood </em>helps us to grasp the scale of it. And once we&rsquo;ve done that, we may gain some possible insights into why polling finds much of the world fearing the U.S. military as a threat to peace, but much of the U.S. public believing that U.S. wars benefit people who are grateful for them. We may begin to form some guesses as to how it is that people in the United States tolerate and even glorify endless mass-killing and destruction, support threatening to use or even using nuclear weapons, and suppose the U.S. to have major enemies out there threatening its &ldquo;freedoms.&rdquo; Viewers of <em>Theaters of War</em> may not all immediately react with &ldquo;Holy shit! The world must think we&rsquo;re lunatics!&rdquo; But a few may ask themselves whether it&rsquo;s possible that wars don&rsquo;t look like they do in movies &mdash; and that would be a great start.</p>
<p><em>Theaters of War</em> ends with a recommendation, that movies be required to disclose at the start any military or CIA collaboration. The film also notes that the United States has laws against propagandizing the U.S. public, which might make such a disclosure a confession of a crime. I would add that<em> s</em>ince 1976, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> has required that &ldquo;Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dark Crystal is a set of protocols, libraries, techniques and guidelines for secure management of sensitive data such as cryptographic keys.</p>
<p>The idea is to make key management easy by emphasising trust between peers rather than individual responsibility.</p>
<p>It is a toolkit for developers who want to bring secure and easy to use key management techniques to their project.  It is particularly well suited for decentralised systems where authentication relies on keys stored on a peer&rsquo;s device.</p>
<div>
  <ul>
<li><strong>Transport agnostic</strong> - Key backup and recovery mechanisms that work with your existing transport mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong> - Pick features which meet the needs of your individual project.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use</strong> - Includes template designs for making intuitive interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering for peers</strong> - Peers keys are secured by trust in their social network.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>There is a <a href="https://gitlab.com/dark-crystal-java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reference implementation in Java</a>, and a <a href="https://gitlab.com/dark-crystal-javascript" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Javascript implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Dark Crystal is 100% open source, licensed <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lesser GPL3</a>.  You can use <a href="https://gitlab.com/dark-crystal-java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our modules</a> in your projects, or just take inspiration from them to implement something similar. Every project has different needs, so we are trying to establish good patterns rather than build a generic tool which everybody should use.</p>
<p>The Dark Crystal Key Backup protocol and Java implementation have been independently audited by <a href="https://includesecurity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Include Security</a>, supported by the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Technology Fund&rsquo;s Red Team Lab</a>. <a href="https://darkcrystal.pw/assets/2021_Q3_OTF_and_Magma_Collective_-_Dark_Crystal_Protocol_-_Report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read the security review report</a></p>
<p>The reference implementation uses conventions from the <a href="https://download.libsodium.org/doc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">libsodium</a> crypto library and <a href="https://github.com/dsprenkels/sss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daan Sprenkle&rsquo;s secret sharing library</a>, both are written in C with bindings to many popular languages.</p>

	<title type="html">Canada's Public Health Agency Criticized for Tracking 33M Mobile Devices</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (or PHAC) "accessed location data from 33 million mobile devices...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (or PHAC) "accessed location data from 33 million mobile devices to monitor people's movement during lockdown," reports Canada's National Post newspaper:


"Due to the urgency of the pandemic, PHAC collected and used mobility data, such as cell-tower location data, throughout the COVID-19 response," a spokesperson told National Post... PHAC used the location data to evaluate the effectiveness of public lockdown measures and allow the Agency to "understand possible links between movement of populations within Canada and spread of COVID-19," the spokesperson said. 

In March, the Agency awarded a contract to the Telus Data For Good program to provide "de-identified and aggregated data" of movement trends in Canada. The contract expired in October, and PHAC no longer has access to the location data, the spokesperson said. The Agency is planning to track population movement for roughly the next five years, including to address other public health issues, such as "other infectious diseases, chronic disease prevention and mental health," the spokesperson added. 

Privacy advocates raised concerns to the National Post about the long-term implications of the program. "I think that the Canadian public will find out about many other such unauthorized surveillance initiatives before the pandemic is over &mdash; and afterwards," David Lyon, author of Pandemic Surveillance and former director of the Surveillance Studies Centre at Queen's University, said in an email.... Increased use of surveillance technology during the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new normal in the name of security, Lyon said. "The pandemic has created opportunities for a massive surveillance surge on many levels &mdash; not only for public health, but also for monitoring those working, shopping and learning from home." 

"Evidence is coming in from many sources, from countries around the world, that what was seen as a huge surveillance surge &mdash; post 9/11 &mdash; is now completely upstaged by pandemic surveillance," he added.</p><p></p><div>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Washington Post reports:

China is turning a major part of its internal Internet data surveillance network outward, mining Western social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to equip its government agencies, military and police with information on foreign targets, according to a Washington Post review of hundreds of Chinese bidding documents, contracts and company filings. 

China maintains a countrywide network of government data surveillance services &mdash; called public opinion analysis software &mdash; that were developed over the past decade and are used domestically to warn officials of politically sensitive information online. The software primarily targets China's domestic Internet users and media, but a Washington Post review of bidding documents and contracts for over 300 Chinese government projects since the beginning of 2020 include orders for software designed to collect data on foreign targets from sources such as Twitter, Facebook and other Western social media.... These surveillance dragnets are part of a wider drive by Beijing to refine its foreign propaganda efforts through big data and artificial intelligence. They also form a network of warning systems designed to sound real-time alarms for trends that undermine Beijing's interests... Some of the Chinese government's budgeting includes buying and maintaining foreign social media accounts on behalf of police and propaganda departments.... 

 The documents describe highly customizable programs that can collect real-time social media data from individual social media users. Some describe tracking broad trends on issues including U.S. elections... The exact scope of China's government public opinion monitoring industry is unclear, but there have been some indications about its size in Chinese state media. In 2014, the state-backed newspaper China Daily said more than 2 million people were working as public opinion analysts... In June 2020, Twitter suspended 23,000 accounts that it said were linked to the Chinese Communist Party and covertly spreading propaganda to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. This month, Twitter said it removed a further 2,048 accounts linked to Beijing and producing coordinated content undermining accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang. 

 Experts say those accounts represent a small fraction of China's efforts to boost pro-Beijing messaging on foreign social media. 
Reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson told the Post," We prohibit use of our API for surveillance purposes, as per our developer policy and terms." 

The Post adds that Facebook "did not respond to requests for comment about whether it is aware of the monitoring...."</p><p></p><div>

The company acts as an information management service for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, corporations like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JP Morgan</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/22/airbus-believes-its-ai-can-eliminate-flight-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbus</a>, and dozens of other local, state, and federal agencies. It&rsquo;s been described by scholars as a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;secondary surveillance network,&rdquo;</a> since it extensively catalogs and maps interpersonal relationships between individuals, even those who aren't suspected of a crime.</p></span></p><p><span><p>Palantir software is instrumental to the operations of ICE, which is planning one of the largest-ever targeted immigration enforcement raids this weekend on thousands of undocumented families. Activists argue <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj9ez3/why-protesters-want-palantir-to-disarmice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raids of this scale</a> would be impossible without software like Palantir. But few people outside the company and its customers know how its software works or what its specific capabilities and user interfaces are.</p></span><span><p>Through a public record request, Motherboard has obtained a user manual that gives unprecedented insight into Palantir Gotham (Palantir&rsquo;s other services, Palantir Foundry, is an enterprise data platform), which is used by law enforcement agencies like the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. The NCRIC serves around 300 communities in northern California and is what is known as a "<a href="https://epic.org/privacy/fusion/#background" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fusion center</a>," a Department of Homeland Security intelligence center that <a href="https://ncric.org/html/NCRIC_MOU_2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aggregates and investigates information</a> from state, local, and federal agencies, as well as some private entities, into large databases that can be searched using software like Palantir.</p></span><span><p>Fusion centers have become a target of civil liberties groups in part because they collect and aggregate data from so many different public and private entities.

It also shows how police are instructed to use the software. This guide seems to be specifically made by Palantir for the California law enforcement because it includes examples specific to California. We don&rsquo;t know exactly what information is excluded, or what changes have been made since the document was first created. The first eight pages that we received in response to our request is undated, but the remaining twenty-one pages were copyrighted in 2016. (Palantir did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)</p></span><span><p>The Palantir user guide shows that police can start with almost no information about a person of interest and instantly know extremely intimate details about their lives. The capabilities are staggering, according to the guide:</p></span></p><p><span><ul>
<li>If police have a name that&rsquo;s associated with a license plate, they can use automatic license plate reader data to find out where they&rsquo;ve been, and when they&rsquo;ve been there. This can give a complete account of where someone has driven over <em>any</em> time period.</li>
<li>With a name, police can also find a person's email address, phone numbers, current and previous addresses, bank accounts, social security number(s), business relationships, family relationships, and license information like height, weight, and eye color, as long as it's in the agency's database.</li>
<li>The software can map out a person's family members and business associates of a suspect, and theoretically, find the above information about them, too.</li>
</ul></span><span><p>All of this information is aggregated and synthesized in a way that gives law enforcement nearly omniscient knowledge over any suspect they decide to surveil.</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="1562941061041-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101139-AM"></picture></div></div><p>An instructional flowchart showing how to search for people tied to a specific vehicle or license plate.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2><span>TERMS TO KNOW</span></h2><p><span><p>Most of the Palantir guide is written in the company&rsquo;s technical language, so it can be hard to parse if you haven't used the software or aren't familiar with it. Here are the important terms to know:</p></span><span><p><strong>OBJECTS:</strong> Any piece of data. This data could be a name, address, phone number, bank account number, etc.</p></span><span><p><strong>HISTOGRAM:</strong> A chart. Specifically, a chart that looks like a web and makes connections between things. This feature kind of looks like the <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/film/news/a7703/detective-show-crazy-walls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"detective wall"</a> trope from TV and movies, but since it&rsquo;s digitized, it&rsquo;s much more fast, powerful, and dense.</p></span></p></div><p><span><p><strong>ALPR/AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE READER:</strong> A camera that takes pictures of cars and license plates. They&rsquo;re usually located at toll booths, or intersections on heavily trafficked roads, though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/we-know-where-youve-been-ars-acquires-4-6m-license-plate-scans-from-the-cops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">police also have mobile versions of them</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive databases of license plate information</a>. Each city in California <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/california-automated-license-plate-reader-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has different ALPR privacy policies</a> about how the information can be used and shared.</p></span><span><p><strong>HEATMAP:</strong> A map that shows how many things there are in a particular area. A higher concentration of things is usually shown in a darker or richer color. Palantir advertises Gotham as a tool that transforms huge amounts of data into actionable maps for police investigations.</p></span></p><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="1562940921088-Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-101333-AM"></picture></div></div><p>Search results showing that a single license plate can be tracked around the state using Automatic License Plate Reader data.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2><span>THE DATA</span></h2><p><span><p>All data points in Palantir are referred to as &ldquo;Objects,&rdquo; and these objects can be practically anything.

For instance, a Palantir screenshot included in the guide show that the NCRIC lets police pull from the record management systems of the San Mateo and Palo Alto Police Departments. This exemplifies Palantir's selling point: the system can synthesize enormous amounts of data from various sources.

These tools all let police graph, map, visualize, and connect dozens of different types of data points. So, police can chart the relationships between individuals. Police can click on an individual on this chart and see everything about them: their email addresses, their bank account information, their license information, etc. Police can also put current addresses, previous addresses, locations of a suspected crime, work locations, family addresses, and travel history (as captured by ALPR-cameras) on a map.</p></span><span><p><strong>Histogram Tool</strong></p></span><span><p>The Histogram tool, as stated by the Palantir guide, helps police find &ldquo;correlations&rdquo; and &ldquo;trends&rdquo; between different Objects, or data points. This can help police decipher a person&rsquo;s behavior. Police can also create &ldquo;Virtual Dossiers&rdquo; at the end of their investigations, which centralizes their analysis into a single place.</p></span></p></div><div><div><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* ,https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1562938974389-Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-113953-AM.png?resize=20:* "></source><img alt="Palantir Histogram Helper section of the user guide."></picture></div></div><p>Image: Palantir Histogram Helper section of the user guide.</p></div></div><p><span><p><strong>Map Tool</strong></p></span><span><p>The Map tool lets police do three things: complete &ldquo;Geosearches,&rdquo; create &ldquo;Heatmaps,&rdquo; and search an Automatic License Plate Reader (ALPR) database.</p></span></p><p><span><p>Geosearches lets police see Objects, visually, within a certain radius on a map.</p></span><span><p>&ldquo;The purple radius, polygon, route, or recent buttons allow you to draw a shape and search for objects/properties that are within the search area,&rdquo; the Palantir guide says.</p></span><span><p>Heatmaps show the concentration of Objects on a map.

<p dir="auto">Diagon is an interactive interpreter. It transforms markdown-style expression
into an ascii-art representation.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is written in C++ and use WebAssembly, HTML and CSS to make a Web
Application.
We also expose a command line interface, for personal and 3rd party tools.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/</a></p>

<p dir="auto">Diagon is also usable as a command line tool.
For instance:</p>
<div><pre><span>echo</span> <span><span>"</span>1+1/2 + sum(i,0,10) = 112/2<span>"</span></span> <span>|</span> diagon Math

<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<ul><li>Two Egyptians&mdash;exiled politician Ayman Nour and the host of a popular news program (who wishes to remain anonymous)&mdash;were hacked with Predator spyware, built and sold by the previously little-known mercenary spyware developer Cytrox.</li>
<li>The phone of Ayman Nour was simultaneously infected with both Cytrox&rsquo;s Predator and NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware, operated by <em>two different government clients.</em></li>
<li>Both targets were hacked with Predator in June 2021, and the spyware was able to infect the then-latest version (14.6) of Apple&rsquo;s iOS operating system using single-click links sent via WhatsApp.</li>
<li>We obtained samples of Predator&rsquo;s &ldquo;loader,&rdquo; the first phase of the spyware, and analyzed their functionality. We found that Predator persists after reboot using the iOS <em>automations</em> feature.</li>
<li>We conducted Internet scanning for Predator spyware servers and found likely Predator customers in Armenia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Madagascar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Serbia.</li>
<li>Cytrox was reported to be part of <a href="https://intellexa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Intellexa</span></a>, the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-lucrative-government-spyware-industry-has-a-new-one-1832568791" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>so-called</span></a> &ldquo;Star Alliance of spyware,&rdquo; which was formed to compete with NSO Group, and which describes itself as &ldquo;EU-based and regulated, with six sites and R&amp;D labs throughout Europe.&rdquo;</li>
</ul><h2><strong>1. Background</strong></h2>
<p>We confirmed the hacking of the devices of two individuals with Cytrox&rsquo;s Predator spyware: Ayman Nour, a member of the Egyptian political opposition living in exile in Turkey, and an Egyptian exiled journalist who hosts a popular news program and wishes to remain anonymous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/28/ayman-nour-sisi-has-made-egypt-a-swamp-of-tyranny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Ayman Nour</span></a> is the president of the Egyptian political opposition group <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/arabic-press-review-egypts-new-opposition-front-and-palestinian-self-demolish-his-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Union of the Egyptian National Forces</span></a>. Nour is also a former Egyptian presidential candidate and founder and chairperson of the <em>Ghad al-Thawra</em> party.<a href="https://citizenlab.ca#fn1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> In 2005, Nour <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/28/ayman-nour-sisi-has-made-egypt-a-swamp-of-tyranny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>ran</span></a> against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. After the election, Nour was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/middleeast/19egypt.html?hp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>convicted</span></a> of &ldquo;forging signatures on petitions&rdquo; filed to create his political party&mdash;a charge which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/middleeast/19egypt.html?hp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>widely considered</span></a> to be &ldquo;politically inspired&rdquo;&mdash;and imprisoned for more than four years. Nour was finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/middleeast/19egypt.html?hp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>released</span></a> from prison in 2009 on health grounds and after international pressure.</p>
<p>Nour was a candidate of the <em>Ghad Al-Thawra party</em> in the 2012 Egyptian presidential elections. He was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17717268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>excluded</span></a> from the elections along with a number of other opposition candidates. In 2013, after opposing President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi&rsquo;s military coup, Nour <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP305_Dunne_and_Hamzawy_Parties_Final_Web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>fled</span></a> Egypt for Lebanon. In 2015, the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon declined to renew his passport and Nour departed Lebanon for Turkey, where he has resided since 2015. He remains a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/28/ayman-nour-sisi-has-made-egypt-a-swamp-of-tyranny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>vocal critic</span></a> of Sisi&rsquo;s regime, describing his government as an &ldquo;oppressive military regime.&rdquo; He has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-president-sissi-wins-approval-from-lawmakers-to-stay-in-office-until-2030/2019/04/16/3d934824-6068-11e9-bf24-db4b9fb62aa2_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>accused</span></a> Sisi&rsquo;s government of &ldquo;extreme human rights violations&rdquo; and of turning the country into a &ldquo;fully autocratic state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second target whose phone we confirmed was hacked with Cytrox&rsquo;s Predator spyware is an Egyptian exiled journalist and an outspoken critic of the Sisi regime. This target has chosen to remain anonymous.</p>
<h3><strong>1.1. Enter: Cytrox</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/231439-87#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>2017</span></a>, Cytrox&rsquo;s business activity is blandly <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cytrox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>described</span></a> in Crunchbase as providing governments with an &ldquo;operational cyber solution&rdquo; that includes gathering information from devices and cloud services. In <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/231439-87#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Pitchbook</span></a>, their technology is defined as &ldquo;cyber intelligence systems designed to offer security&rdquo; to governments and assist with &ldquo;designing, managing and implementing cyber intelligence gathering in the network, enabling businesses to gather intelligence from both end devices as well as from cloud services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cytrox reportedly began life as a North <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/05/a-multimillionaire-surveillance-dealer-steps-out-of-the-shadows-and-his-9-million-whatsapp-hacking-van/?sh=12a0efe31b71" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Macedonian</a> start-up.<a href="https://citizenlab.ca#fn2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> A review of corporate registry documents shows that Cytrox appears to have a corporate presence in Israel and Hungary.</p>
<p>Cytrox&rsquo;s Israeli companies were founded in 2017 as Cytrox EMEA Ltd. and Cytrox Software Ltd. Perhaps taking a page from <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Candiru</span></a>&rsquo;s corporate obfuscation playbook, both of those companies were renamed in 2019 to Balinese Ltd. and Peterbald Ltd., respectively. We also observed one entity in Hungary, Cytrox Holdings Zrt, which was also <a href="https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.cytrox_holdings_z%C3%A1rtk%C3%B6r%C5%B1en_m%C5%B1k%C3%B6d%C5%91_r%C3%A9szv%C3%A9nyt%C3%A1rsas%C3%A1g.845c1fa4c3b2b109b79e138bdb55a3cb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>formed</span></a> in 2017.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, we believe that Cytrox&rsquo;s CEO is Ivo Malinkovksi, as stated on his <a href="https://mk.linkedin.com/in/ivo-malinkovski-54a2088b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>LinkedIn</span></a> page. Notably, Malinkovksi&rsquo;s now-private Instagram account includes a 2019 image of him in front of the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.</p>
<p>A 2019 report in <em>Forbes</em> states that Cytrox was &ldquo;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/05/a-multimillionaire-surveillance-dealer-steps-out-of-the-shadows-and-his-9-million-whatsapp-hacking-van/?sh=12a0efe31b71" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>rescued</span></a>&rdquo; by Tal Dilian, a former Israel Defence Forces (IDF) Unit 81 <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-a-shady-israeli-intel-genius-his-cyber-spy-van-and-million-dollar-deals-1.9413973" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>commander</span></a>, whose company WiSpear (which appears to have been <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/cy/HE318328" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>renamed</span></a> <a href="https://efiling.drcor.mcit.gov.cy/DrcorPublic/SearchResults.aspx?name=%25&amp;number=318328&amp;searchtype=optStartMatch&amp;index=1&amp;lang=EN&amp;tname=%25&amp;sc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Passitora Ltd.</span></a>) is based in Limassol, Cyprus and reportedly acquired Cytrox in 2018 <a href="https://www.atooro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>according</span></a> to the Atooro Fund.

<h3><strong>1.2. Cytrox, a Part of the &ldquo;Intellexa Alliance&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>The following section is not a complete accounting of the relationship between Cytrox and other entities. It is based on a review of a mix of media reports and a nonexhaustive review of company registries across various jurisdictions. Additional research into Intellexa and the companies that form this marketing alliance could potentially provide useful insight into how commercial surveillance companies employ complex business structures and use measures that obfuscate their operations.</p>
<h4><strong>The Link between Cytrox and Intellexa</strong></h4>
<p>Cytrox is <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90369108/inside-the-shadowy-world-of-spyware-makers-that-target-activists-and-dissidents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>part of</span></a> the so-called &ldquo;Intellexa alliance,&rdquo; a marketing label for a range of mercenary surveillance vendors that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90369108/inside-the-shadowy-world-of-spyware-makers-that-target-activists-and-dissidents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>emerged</span></a> in 2019. The consortium of companies includes Nexa Technologies (formerly Amesys), WiSpear/Passitora Ltd., Cytrox, and Senpai, along with other unnamed entities, purportedly seeking to compete against other players in the cyber surveillance market such as NSO Group and Verint.</p>

<p>In our preliminary research, the specific link between Cytrox and Intellexa, as well as other companies in the &ldquo;alliance,&rdquo; remains murky at best. In reviewing filings in the Israeli business registry, we observed a 2020 transfer of all shares held by Cytrox Holdings Zrt (Hungary) in Cytrox EMEA Ltd./Balinese Ltd. (Israel) to Aliada Group Inc., an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands (registration no. 1926732). Prior to this share transfer, Cytrox Holdings Zrt appears to have been the sole shareholder of shares in Cytrox EMEA Ltd./Balinese and after this share transfer it seems to remain the sole shareholder in Cytrox Software Ltd./Peterbald. Further, an article from <em>Intelligence Online</em> in 2017 <a href="https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2017/09/20/with-wispear-gsm-interception-champion-tal-dilian-gets-into-wifi,108262318-art" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>notes</span></a> that WiSpear Systems is &ldquo;owned by Aliada Group Inc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Information on Aliada Group Inc. is relatively scant. The same 2017 article from <em>Intelligence Online</em> notes that Aliada Group Inc. is &ldquo;backed by the private equity firm Mivtach-Shamir, which spent $3.5 million to acquire a 32% stake in Aliada in December 2016, along with an option to acquire an additional 5%.&rdquo; Mivtach-Shamir is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mivtach-shamir-holdings-ltd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>a publicly-traded Israeli investment company</span></a>&rdquo; founded by Meir Shamir. In reviewing entries for WiSpear/Passitora Ltd. in Cyprus&rsquo; business registry, we noted that &ldquo;Mivtah Shamir Technologies (2000) Ltd.&rdquo; is listed as a director of Passitora Ltd., along with Dilian. We also found an entry in the Israeli business registry for a &ldquo;Mivtach Shamir Technologies (2000) Ltd.,&rdquo; which was apparently incorporated in 2000.</p>
<p>Further, a 2020 <em>Haaretz</em> <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-a-shady-israeli-intel-genius-his-cyber-spy-van-and-million-dollar-deals-1.9413973" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>article</span></a> noted that Avi Rubinstein, a &ldquo;high-tech entrepreneur, filed a lawsuit against Dilian in Tel Aviv District Court.&rdquo;<a href="https://citizenlab.ca#fn4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a> According to <em>Haaretz</em>, Aliada Group Inc. is described in the litigation as &ldquo;a group of cyberweapon companies whose products are branded under the name Intellexa.&rdquo; Two other individuals, Oz Liv, who was also a commander in Unit 81, and Meir Shamir, are also named as defendants. According to <em>Haaretz</em>, these two individuals, along with Rubinstein, who filed the suit, and Dilian, are all shareholders in Aliada Group Inc.</p>
<p><em>Haaretz</em> further notes that Rubinstein is accusing Dilian, Liv, and Shamir of acting <em>&ldquo;illegally to dilute [Rubinstein&rsquo;s] own shares through a pyramid of companies set up overseas. Some of those companies were established via front men connected to Dilian, including his second wife, Sara Hamou&rdquo;</em> (as noted above, Hamou&rsquo;s name appears in corporate registry listings in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet database for Intellexa entities in Ireland and Greece). The lawsuit also reportedly claimed that <em>&ldquo;this transfer of Aliada&rsquo;s activities out of Israel via shell companies, first to the British Virgin Islands and later Ireland, violated both Israeli and foreign defense export control laws.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the BVI Registrar of Corporate Affairs, as of the date of publication of this report, Aliada Group Inc.&rsquo;s legal status is &ldquo;in penalty&rdquo; due to nonpayment of annual fees. In addition, the registered agent filed an intent to resign on November 12, 2021. The reason for the resignation is as yet unclear.</p>
<h4><strong>Intellexa&rsquo;s Products</strong></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211004210723/https://intellexa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>prior version of the Intellexa website</span></a> markets &ldquo;intelligence solutions&rdquo; including &ldquo;tactical interception.&rdquo; The marketing of interception was also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/05/a-multimillionaire-surveillance-dealer-steps-out-of-the-shadows-and-his-9-million-whatsapp-hacking-van/?sh=27618a2f31b7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>underscored</span></a> in Dilian&rsquo;s 2019 <em>Forbes</em> interview. However, at the time of writing, the website is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211212011206/https://intellexa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>considerably more vague</span></a> about the company&rsquo;s activities. In its current form, Intellexa&rsquo;s website and associated videos pitch a product called &ldquo;Nebula&rdquo; which is described as a &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; intelligence gathering and analysis platform.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-3.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-3.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 3: Text from the Intellexa website at time of writing.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The company&rsquo;s website prominently features the claim that it is &ldquo;EU-based and regulated.&rdquo; This claim is interesting given the track record of some of Intellexa&rsquo;s participating corporate entities, which have been riddled with legal issues and other controversy. For example, in June 2021, executives of Amesys and Nexa Technologies <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/north-africa-middle-east/egypt/surveillance-and-torture-in-egypt-and-libya-amesys-and-nexa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>were indicted</span></a> by investigating judges with the crimes against humanity and war crimes unit of the Paris Judicial Court for complicity in torture in relation to product sales to the Libyan government and complicity in torture and forced dissapearance in relation to product sales to the Egyptian government.</p>
<p>Dilian has also been followed by <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-cyprus-israel-spies-arab-world-cyber-something-wrong-1.8317030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>reports</span></a> of legal and other irregularities, both during his time in the Israeli military and in his new career as a mercenary surveillance tech vendor. In 2019, after courting publicity with a demonstration to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/05/a-multimillionaire-surveillance-dealer-steps-out-of-the-shadows-and-his-9-million-whatsapp-hacking-van/?sh=1783ac2b31b7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Forbes</span></a> of a &ldquo;$9 million signals intelligence van&rdquo; with communications hacking capabilities in Cyprus, WiSpear and Tal Dilian attracted police interest. The van was confiscated by Cypriot authorities, several WiSpear/Passitora Ltd. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/12/20/cyprus-arrests-surveillance-company-staff-after-forbes-whatsapp-hacking-van-video-causes-stir/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>employees were arrested</span></a> and briefly detained, and Dilian was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-spy-tech-ceo-wanted-for-questioning-by-cypriot-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>wanted for questioning</span></a>.</p>
<p>According to a 2020 <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-spy-specialreport-idUSKCN22A2G1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>article</span></a> Dilian&mdash;who <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-spy-tech-ceo-wanted-for-questioning-by-cypriot-police/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>characterized</span></a> the Cypriot investigation as a &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; against him&mdash;fled Cyprus after an arrest warrant was issued in his name. An article in <em>CyprusMail</em> from November 2021 <a href="https://cyprus-mail.com/2021/11/16/akel-cries-foul-as-ag-remains-tight-lipped-over-dropping-spy-van-charges/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>notes</span></a> that the Attorney-General&rsquo;s office decided to &ldquo;drop all charges&rdquo; against all three individuals involved in the &ldquo;spy van&rdquo; case (the case against WiSpear/Passitora Ltd. was not dropped). Reporting from the same month notes that WiSpear was fined <a href="https://news-primer.com/surveillance-company-pays-1-million-fine-after-spy-van-scandal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>almost 1 million Euros</span></a> for privacy violations.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Attacks against the Two Targets</strong></h2>
<p>Nour first became suspicious after observing that his iPhone was &ldquo;running hot.&rdquo; We learned of Nour&rsquo;s case and reviewed logs from his phone. Ultimately, we determined that his device had been exploited and infected with <em>two separate mercenary spyware tools:</em> Pegasus spyware, made by NSO Group, and Predator, which is developed by Cytrox.</p>
<p>We attribute the attacks on the two targets to the Egyptian Government with medium-high confidence. We conducted scanning (Section 4) that identified the Egyptian Government as a Cytrox Predator customer, websites used in the hacks of the two targets bore Egyptian themes, and the messages that initiated the hack were sent from Egyptian WhatsApp numbers (Section 2.5, Section 2.7).</p>
<h3><strong>2.1. Confirming NSO Pegasus Infection of Ayman Nour</strong></h3>
<p>The logs showed that Nour&rsquo;s phone had been repeatedly compromised with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware since March 3, 2021. For example, evidence of execution of the following processes was identified on Nour&rsquo;s phone, dating back to March 3, 2021:</p>
<div>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/tisppd/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/bfrgbd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/xpccfd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/comsercvd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/rlaccountd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/launchrexd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/ckeblld</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/comnetd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/accountpfd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/jlmvskrd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/msgacntd</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/brstaged</code></p>
<p><code>/private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/fdlibframed</code></p>
</div>
<p>These process names all appear on a list of Pegasus indicators published by Amnesty Tech and we have also independently linked them to Pegasus. Crash logs also showed that on June 30, 2021, NSO Group&rsquo;s <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><strong><span>FORCEDENTRY</span></strong></em> <span>exploit</span></a> (CVE-2021-30860) was fired at the phone. The exploit did <em>not</em> result in installation of the Pegasus spyware at this time.</p>
<p>Based on the traces of <em><strong>FORCEDENTRY</strong></em>, the presence of process names linked to Pegasus, and additional factors, we conclude with high confidence that the phone was repeatedly hacked with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware starting on March 3, 2021.</p>
<h3><strong>2.2. Confirming Cytrox Predator Infection of Ayman Nour</strong></h3>
<p>After confirming forensic traces of Pegasus on Nour&rsquo;s iPhone, we identified the presence of additional spyware, which we attribute with high confidence to Cytrox. We further conclude with high confidence that it is unrelated to Pegasus spyware.</p>
<p>While examining the iPhone logs we determined that, on June 30, 2021, two commands <code>&ldquo;/Payload2&rdquo;</code> were running on the phone (PIDs 339 and 1272), and that these commands had been launched with a single argument, a URL on <code>distedc[.]com</code>. The commands were running as root.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-4-1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-4-1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 4: Listing of commands running on Nour&rsquo;s phone.</figcaption></figure>
<p>iPhone logs indicated that the process names of the commands were <em>UserEventAgent</em> and <em>com.apple.WebKit.Networking</em>, that their binaries were resident on disk in the <em>/private/var/tmp/</em> folder, and that the responsible process for both was <em>siriactionsd</em>, which is a legitimate iOS process that manages iOS shortcuts and automations.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Phone logs showing process names of the commands, and paths to binaries on disk." loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Figure-5.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 5: Phone logs showing process names of the commands, and paths to binaries on disk.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While iOS has legitimate binaries with the names &ldquo;com.apple.WebKit.Networking&rdquo; and &ldquo;UserEventAgent&rdquo;, the binaries in Figures 5 do not match any known legitimate Apple version. Moreover, the legitimate iOS binaries with these names are not stored in <code>/private/var/tmp/</code>. The two suspicious processes were running as part of the &ldquo;<code>com.apple.WorkflowKit.BackgroundShortcutRunner</code>&rdquo; launchd coalition. We found two additional suspicious processes that had recently run in this same coalition, named &ldquo;hooker&rdquo; and &ldquo;takePhoto&rdquo;.</p>
<h3><strong>2.3. Attribution to Cytrox</strong></h3>
<p>We looked up the IP address for distedc[.]com on Internet scanning service <a href="https://censys.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Censys</span></a> and found that, as of October 2021, it returned an HTTP 302 redirect to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://duckduckgo.com</span></a>. Concluding that this might be an identifying behavior, we built a <a href="https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&amp;per_page=25&amp;virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&amp;q=services.http.response.body_hash%3A%60sha1%3A8490a34ab83d79b3b5f66dbd4484438717b6dca7%60+and+services.http.response.headers.access_control_allow_origin%3A%60*%60" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Censys fingerprint</span></a> for the redirect.</p>
<p>We found 28 hosts on Censys matching this fingerprint in October 2021, including an IP in Northern Macedonia, <code>62.162.5[.]58</code>, which was pointed to by <code>dev-bh.cytrox[.]com</code> in August 2020, and which also returned a redirect with <code>dev-bh.cytrox[.]com</code> in its Location header <a href="https://www.shodan.io/host/62.162.5.58/history#80" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>on port 80 during this period</span></a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, passive DNS tool <a href="https://www.riskiq.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>RiskIQ</span></a> shows that the IP 62.162.5[.]58 returned a certificate (0fb1b8da5f2e63da70b0ab3bba8438f30708282f) for teslal[.]xyz between July 2020 and September 2020. Since <code>62.162.5[.]58</code> currently returns a <code>teslal[.]xyz</code> certificate, we assume that the IP has not changed ownership since August 2020 and is thus still related to <code>cytrox[.]com</code>.</p>

<p>The <em>cytrox.com</em> domain previously returned a WordPress page containing an email address (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/ivo@cytrox.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>ivo@cytrox.com</span></a>), which appears to be the email of Ivo Malinkovski, CEO of Cytrox. The WordPress page is apparently unmaintained, and was apparently hacked to include spam links to an online casino (Figure 6).</p>
<p>We analyzed binaries associated with the spyware (Section 3), which revealed that the spyware is named &ldquo;Predator.&rdquo; We performed additional fingerprinting and scanning (Section 4) that allowed us to identify additional components of Cytrox client infrastructure.</p>
<h3><strong>2.4. Observation of Additional Domains</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to distedc[.]com, we observed additional domains associated with the Predator installation on the two victim phones.</p>

<h3><strong>2.5. How Ayman Nour was Hacked with Predator</strong></h3>
<p>We searched Nour&rsquo;s phone for these domains and found that an Egyptian number on WhatsApp (+201201407978), purporting to be a &ldquo;Dr. Rania Shhab,&rdquo; sent four distinct links to almasryelyuom[.]com and qwxzyl[.]com to Nour&rsquo;s device. The links were sent as images containing URLs. The same WhatsApp account sent a link to youtu-be[.]net, which we assess is also related, because the server response for youtu-be[.]net matches that of almasryelyuom[.]com and qwxzyl[.]com.</p>
<p>The following are examples of images accompanying the links sent by the attacker, extracted from Nour&rsquo;s phone:</p>

<h3><strong>2.6. Evidence of Predator and Pegasus Running Simultaneously</strong></h3>
<p>Phone logs indicate that on June 22, 2021, Pegasus and Predator were <em>running simultaneously</em> on Nour&rsquo;s phone, as these four processes were observed running simultaneously:</p>
<figure><table headertable="true" readabilitydatatable="1"><thead><th><strong>PID</strong></th>

</tr></tbody></table><figcaption><p><strong>Table 2: Pegasus and Predator processes running simultaneously on Nour&rsquo;s phone on June 22, 2021.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone logs indicate that the device was infected with Pegasus on June 22 at 13:26 GMT. A number of <em>Library/SMS/Attachments</em> folders were created between 13:17 and 13:21, and there were no entries whatsoever in the <em>Attachments</em> table of the <em>sms.db</em> file for June 22, suggesting that a zero-click exploit may have been the vector for Pegasus installation. Approximately an hour later, a Predator link sent to Nour on WhatsApp was opened in Safari at 14:33 GMT on the same day and Predator was installed on the device two minutes later at 14:35 GMT.</p>
<h3><strong>2.7. How Second Target was Hacked with Predator</strong></h3>
<p>The second target, an Egyptian journalist in exile who is the host of a popular news program, received one message on WhatsApp from an unknown number (+201201407595) with a link to the same almasryelyuom[.]com website.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-11.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-11.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 11: Second target is targeted with Predator.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The individual who sent the link claimed that they were an Assistant Editor at the <em>Al Masry Al Youm</em> newspaper.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Analysis of Cytrox&rsquo;s Predator Spyware</strong></h2>
<p>We obtained Android and iOS payloads from distedc[.]com and found them to be copies of a loader for a spyware product called Predator. We believe that these payloads are invoked by a previous exploit phase that we do not have.</p>
<h3><strong>3.1. Initialization</strong></h3>
<p>The iPhone executable is a 64-bit Mach-O binary which, like its Android counterpart, expects two arguments when the binary&rsquo;s <code>main</code> function is called, which appear to be a kernel process task port and a pid value. The <code>main</code> function then calls <code>kmem_init</code> with these values, which proceeds to enable Predator stage 1 for continued execution. The Android sample passes its arguments to shared constants <code>SHMEMFD_VSS</code> and <code>SHMEMFD_VSS</code>.</p>
<p>Both the iOS and Android samples then call a <code>startPy</code> function to load a bundled Python 2.7 runtime. In the iOS sample, two additional built-in objects are added to the runtime: <code>predutils</code> and predconfig. The Android sample contains further additional built-in objects: injector, pc2, recorder, and voip_recorder. Upon initialization, startPy loads a frozen Python module named loader which begins by importing the Predator config from the interpreter&rsquo;s predconfig module.</p>
<p>The iOS and Android configurations are slightly different. The complete configurations are available in <strong>Appendix 1</strong>. Once Predator iOS loads its configuration, it loads another frozen Python module named km_ios, a utility module that provides kernel memory management helper functions enabling additional Predator module capabilities.</p>
<p>The iOS payload also contains a _check function, which queries the phone number and the phone&rsquo;s current locale country code. If the locale country code is equal to &ldquo;IL&rdquo; (the country code for Israel), or the phone number begins with &ldquo;+972&rdquo; (the telephone country code for Israel) then the spyware terminates. However, the method that Predator uses to query the phone number, CTSettingCopyMyPhoneNumber, may not work in recent versions of iOS. We could not determine how (or if) the _check function is called.</p>
<h3><strong>3.2. Python Loader</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the frozen loader module, &ldquo;src/loader.py&rdquo; (&ldquo;frozenpyc/src/loader.py&rdquo; in the Android sample), we also found copies of what appear to be older versions of the module that do not appear to be invoked by Predator: &ldquo;src/loader2.py&rdquo;, &ldquo;src/loader_real.py&rdquo; and &ldquo;src/loaderBackup03&rdquo;. All of the loader versions contain multiple references to &ldquo;Predator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After loading the Predator configuration, the iOS loader then wipes the device&rsquo;s crash logs by removing all files in &ldquo;/private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/&rdquo;. Then, it downloads a configuration file and additional stages of the spyware from the server (specified by predconfig&rsquo;s INS_URL parameter, which is set to https://bity[.]ws).</p>

<p>On Android, the loader module also downloads additional files from the server (specified by predconfig&rsquo;s INS_URL parameter, which is set to https://egyqaz[.]com).</p>
<h3><strong>3.3. Persistence on iOS</strong></h3>
<p>On iOS, the loader calls a get_configuration_persistency function, which downloads an iOS shortcuts automation from the spyware server to ensure persistence. The persistent payload is referred to as &ldquo;Nahum,&rdquo; which is the name of a minor biblical prophet. Nahum&rsquo;s prophecy appears in the Hebrew Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament, and foretells the total destruction of Nineveh, a powerful fortress city.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Nineveh is destroyed, deserted, desolate! Hearts melt with fear; knees tremble, strength is gone; faces grow pale. Where now is the city that was like a den of lions, the place where young lions were fed, where the lion and the lioness would go and their cubs would be safe?</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Nahum 2:10-11 GNB</span></p>
<p>The iOS automation is triggered when certain apps are opened, including a number of built-in Apple apps, such as the App Store, Camera, Mail, Maps, Safari, as well as third-party apps including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, Skype, SnapChat, Viber, Wire, TikTok, Line, OpenVPN, WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-14.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-14.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 14: Automation on Target 2&rsquo;s infected device as viewed in the &ldquo;Automations&rdquo; tab of the &ldquo;Shortcuts&rdquo; app.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The automation first checks if the phone&rsquo;s battery level is greater than 9% (i.e., if the phone is not in a low-battery situation). If the phone&rsquo;s battery level is adequate, then the automation downloads JavaScript code from the spyware server and substitutes this code into a block of HTML contained in the shortcut. We were unable to obtain this JavaScript code. The HTML in the shortcut also contains a JavaScript function &ldquo;make_bogus_transform&rdquo; which appears to create an XSLT transformation that may be invoked by the downloaded JavaScript code. The HTML code with the substituted JavaScript is then Base64-encoded, its contents are prepended with &ldquo;data:text/html,&rdquo; and then the automation passes this URL to WebKit to render. This presumably triggers the exploit and results in the installation of the Predator spyware.</p>
<p>While automations normally trigger visible notifications when they are run, the Predator shortcut runs entirely in the background, invisible to the user, because Predator <em>also</em> changes an option to disable automations from triggering notifications.</p>
<p>The get_configuration_persistency function also downloads an iOS profile named &ldquo;com.[name redacted].disable-shortcuts-notifications&rdquo;, from the spyware server.</p>
<p>We located a profile with the same name publicly released by [name redacted], a software engineering student. We are redacting the name of the student here because we do not believe they are involved in Cytrox Predator development. The profile&rsquo;s sole function is to prevent iOS from displaying notifications when an automation is run. Thus, users who have been hacked with Predator do not see notifications when the spyware is launched.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-15.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fig-15.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 15: Profile to disable automations notifications used by Predator.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is nothing particularly special or complex about this specific profile, and Predator&rsquo;s developers could have easily crafted their own similar profile that duplicated this functionality without mentioning the software engineering student by name.</p>
<p>The <em>get_configuration_persistency</em> function also downloads binaries called &ldquo;takePhoto,&rdquo; &ldquo;agent.dylib,&rdquo; &ldquo;inject,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hooker&rdquo; on iOS14, but does not download these files on iOS13, instead logging the message &ldquo;iOS 13, don&rsquo;t need hooker.&rdquo; We did not obtain these files, but we believe that &ldquo;hooker&rdquo; and &ldquo;takePhoto&rdquo; are the same binaries we saw running in Section 2.2.</p>
<h3><strong>3.4. Additional Android Details</strong></h3>
<p>We did not find a mechanism for persistence on Android, nor values in the Android configuration file that indicate persistence support. However, we found some additional code in the Android sample, including code to disable SELinux and code for an audio recording component.</p>
<p>Predator stores additional Python modules and native ELF binaries in the fs.db SQLite file which is located at the path set in DB_FILE. The Python interpreter has a frozen module called sqlimper which is responsible for interacting with this database. The database contains a table called files which has a column called file_hash and a column called file_data. The file_hash is used in place of a file name and is computed using the following routine, where n is the name:</p>
<p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Android-Details-1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Android-Details-1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p>
<p>The injector module declares one function, inject, which can inject a shared object into a running process. Interestingly, there is a function called prior to injection which attempts to disable SELinux enforcement via the SELinuxFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Android-Details-2.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Android-Details-2.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p>
<p>It should be noted that this approach likely will not succeed on devices that have additional checks and protections around SELinux enforcement&mdash;for example, Samsung RKP. However, there are artifacts associated with Predator that suggest approaches like RKP can be defeated by stomping on the SELinux access vector cache entries to grant the needed permissions.</p>
<p>The pc2 module contains a single function, pc2_send_command, that is used as an IPC mechanism to send commands to Predator&rsquo;s audio recording component. The supported commands are START_VOIP, STOP_VOIP, START_MICRORECORDER, STOP_MICRORECORDER, and POLL_VOIP. This module works in conjunction with the recorder and voip_recorder modules. Each of the recorder modules have a start and stop function which are used to start/stop Predator&rsquo;s hot mic (recorder) and call recording (voip_recorder) capabilities. Recordings are stored in /data/local/tmp/wd/r/ in MP3 format.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Scanning to Find Cytrox Customers</strong></h2>
<p>We fingerprinted the behavior of the domains from Table 1 and found additional domains via Shodan and Censys.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p><strong>Table 3: Shodan and Censys fingerprints for Cytrox domains.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of the Shodan and Censys results, we identified several servers that returned HTTP Server headers with the value &ldquo;Server,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;nginx,&rdquo; These servers were typically hosted on consumer broadband connections available to local subscribers only, rather than cloud-hosting services that can be procured internationally. We believe that the &ldquo;Server: Server&rdquo; IPs on consumer broadband connections are <em>endpoint IPs</em> that indicate locations of customers. We found endpoint IPs in the following countries, so we conclude that these governments are likely among Cytrox&rsquo;s customers:</p>
<p>Armenia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Madagascar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Serbia</p>
<p>Scanning also reveals a range of domains used by Cytrox that have country-specific themes, which leads us to suspect that they may be specifically targeted in relation to these countries. We list a subset of these in Table 4.</p>

<h3><strong>Special Note: Predator after Pegasus for Saudi Arabia?</strong></h3>
<p>An IP address in Saudi Arabia appears to have begun matching our Cytrox Predator fingerprints at the end of July 2021, and we classify this IP address as that of a likely Predator customer. NSO Group&rsquo;s June 30, 2021 transparency report mentions that NSO cut off a client, later reported to be Saudi Arabia by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/middleeast/israel-saudi-khashoggi-hacking-nso.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>the New York Times</span></a>, apparently in response to the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>revelations of spying on Al Jazeera journalists</span></a>. This may be an indication that Saudi Arabia has switched from Pegasus to Predator.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Disclosure &amp; Enforcement</strong></h2>
<p>In accordance with the Citizen Lab&rsquo;s vulnerability disclosure policy, we shared copies of Cytrox Predator forensic artifacts with Apple, which has confirmed to the Citizen Lab that they are investigating. In addition, given the abuse of WhatsApp for Predator targeting, the Citizen Lab shared forensic artifacts with Meta&rsquo;s security team.</p>
<p>Today, Thursday, December 16th, Meta is taking an enforcement action against Cytrox, which includes removing approximately 300 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to Cytrox. Their investigation also reveals an extensive list of lookalike domains used as part of social engineering and malware attacks, which are included in <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Appendix A of their report</a>.</p>
<p>The Meta report states that they believe Cytrox customers include entities in Egypt, Armenia, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Colombia, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Vietnam, Philippines, and Germany, and that they identified additional abusive targeting initiated by Cytrox customers around the world.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This report is the first investigation to discover Cytrox&rsquo;s mercenary spyware being abused to target civil society. Remarkably, one of the victims was <em>simultaneously infected</em> with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware. NSO Group has received outsized publicity in recent years, thanks to a growing customer list, spiraling abuse problems, and groundbreaking investigative work by civil society. Cytrox and its Predator spyware, meanwhile, are relatively unknown.</p>
<p>The targeting of a single individual with both Pegasus and Predator underscores that the practice of hacking civil society transcends any specific mercenary spyware company. Instead, it is a pattern that we expect will persist as long as autocratic governments are able to obtain sophisticated hacking technology. Absent international and domestic regulations and safeguards, journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition groups will continue to be hacked into the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3><strong>The Mercenary Spyware Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>Both the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/tag/nso-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Citizen Lab</span></a> and Amnesty International&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/NSO%20Group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Security Lab</span></a> have produced extensive technical reports on NSO Group. While prominent, the mercenary spyware firm was not the first nor is it the only spyware firm of its kind whose technology has been linked to abuse problems. In fact, the <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/surveillance-technology-at-the-fair/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>market</span></a> for offensive intrusion capabilities is large, varied, and proliferating internationally.</p>
<p>For example, prior to the Citizen Lab&rsquo;s <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>first report</span></a> on NSO Group in 2016, we documented extensive abuses of <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2015/03/hacking-team-reloaded-us-based-ethiopian-journalists-targeted-spyware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Hacking Team</span></a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2015/10/mapping-finfishers-continuing-proliferation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>FinFisher</span></a> mercenary spyware. (Hacking Team was subsequently rebranded <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgq3qd/memento-labs-the-reborn-hacking-team-is-struggling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Memento Labs</span></a> in 2019.) In 2017, we published a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/12/champing-cyberbit-ethiopian-dissidents-targeted-commercial-spyware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> on the spyware firm, Cyberbit, whose technology was used by Ethiopia to mount a global cyber espionage campaign. We also discovered evidence that Cyberbit was marketing its spyware to known human rights abusers, including the Royal Thai Army, the Uzbek secret services, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Rwanda, Serbia, and Nigeria. Earlier this year, we published a report on yet another spyware firm, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Candiru</span></a>, with our findings independently corroborated by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Microsoft</span></a>, <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Google</span></a>, and the <a href="https://www.eset.com/int/about/newsroom/press-releases/research/eset-research-discovers-watering-hole-attacks-on-websites-in-the-middle-east-with-links-to-candiru-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>threat intelligence team</span></a> at ESET. Candiru was subsequently <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>designated</span></a> alongside NSO Group on the U.S. Commerce Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;entity list&rdquo; in November 2021 for &ldquo;malicious cyber activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As evidence continues to surface of new players in the spyware space, the same patterns of abuse will almost certainly persist until the international regulatory environment changes.</p>
<h3><strong>Structures to Avoid Accountability</strong></h3>
<p>The private intelligence and mercenary surveillance marketplace is marked by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DOC1041822021ENGLISH.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>complex ownership structures</span></a>, corporate alliances, and regular rebranding. These practices frustrate investigation, regulation, and accountability. Mercenary spyware companies further evade outside scrutiny by employing complex accounting and incorporation techniques familiar to those used by arms traffickers, money launderers, kleptocrats, and corrupt officials.</p>
<p>As investigative journalists and public interest researchers continue to put a spotlight on mercenary spyware companies, we expect they will continue their efforts to evade scrutiny and accountability.</p>

<p>Across the country, some law enforcement agencies have deployed controversial surveillance technology to track cellphone location and use. Critics say it threatens constitutional rights, and members of Congress have moved to restrain its use.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Nonetheless, in 2019 the Boston Police Department bought the device known as a cell site simulator &mdash; and tapped a hidden pot of money that kept the purchase out of the public eye.</p>

<p>Also known as a &ldquo;stingray,&rdquo; the cell site simulator purchased by Boston police acts like a commercial cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to it. Once the phones connect to the cell site simulator&rsquo;s decoy signal, the equipment secretly obtains location and other potentially identifying information. It can pinpoint someone&rsquo;s location down to a particular room of a hotel or house.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p>While this briefcase-sized device can help locate a suspect or a missing person, it can also scoop up information from other phones in the vicinity, including yours.</p>

<p>The Boston police bought its simulator device using money that is typically taken during drug investigations through what&rsquo;s called civil asset forfeiture.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>An <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/massachusetts-police-can-easily-seize-your-money.-the-da-of-one-county-makes-it-near-impossible-to-get-it-back." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">August investigation by WBUR and ProPublica</a> found that even if no criminal charges are brought, law enforcement almost always keeps the money and has few limitations on how it&rsquo;s spent. Some departments benefit from both state and federal civil asset forfeiture. The police chiefs in Massachusetts have discretion over the money, and the public has virtually no way of knowing how the funds are used.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The Boston City Council reviews the BPD annual budget, scrutinizing proposed spending. But the surveillance equipment wasn&rsquo;t part of the budget. Because it was purchased with civil forfeiture funds, BPD was able to circumvent the council.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>According to an invoice obtained by WBUR, the only city review of the purchase &mdash; which was made with federal forfeiture funds &mdash; came from the Procurement Department, confirming that the funds were available.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>In fact, it was only after sifting through hundreds of documents received through public records requests that WBUR discovered BPD had bought the device from North Carolina-based Tactical Support Equipment Inc., which specializes in surveillance technology.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Sgt. Detective John Boyle, spokesman for the Boston police, did not explain why the department used forfeiture dollars to buy the equipment instead of purchasing it through the regular budget process.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Requests for interviews with Boston police leaders were declined.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p>Boston city councilors interviewed by WBUR said they weren&rsquo;t aware that the police had bought a cell site simulator. Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who represents Mattapan, Hyde Park and Roslindale, said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you, and I don&rsquo;t think anybody on the council can necessarily tell you ... how these individual purchases are made.&rdquo;</p>
        
    
                    
<p>State Rep. Jay Livingstone, who represents parts of Boston and Cambridge, says this kind of covert police spending is exactly why more oversight is needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Police chiefs just have these slush funds they can do whatever they want with,&rdquo; Livingstone said.</p>

<h3>Hidden Purchases</h3>
<p>WBUR discovered the secret purchase of cell site simulator technology when it set out to identify how civil forfeiture money was being spent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>In April, WBUR requested from Boston police all invoices for purchases made with civil asset forfeiture money between 2017 and 2019. One <a href="https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/12/20211028151139384-2-1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transaction</a> stood out: $627,000 paid to Tactical Support Equipment, identified only as a &ldquo;multi-channel, multi-band base station.&rdquo; WBUR obtained model numbers from invoices to establish that this equipment was a stingray.</p>

<p>Boyle, the police department spokesperson, confirmed the technology was a cell site simulator. </p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time the BPD has bought spy equipment that is shrouded in mystery.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>It paid Harris Corporation, a Florida-based defense contractor, more than $400,000 for cell site simulator equipment in 2013-14. While the majority of that money came out of the regular police budget, much of its use and purpose has been redacted in past public records.</p>

<p>At the time, the FBI deemed cell site simulators so specialized that it <a href="https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2021/12/muck-rock-fbi-letters.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prohibited Boston police</a> and other law enforcement from talking about the devices publicly, specifically with the media. Boston received stingray training and equipment as far back as 2009, according to a Harris invoice acquired by <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/boston-3/policies-procedures-figures-and-contracts-concerning-imsi-catchers-boston-police-department-29277/#file-107836" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Muckrock.com</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>When Harris <a href="https://gizmodo.com/american-cops-turns-to-canadian-phone-tracking-firm-aft-1845442778" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discontinued the stingray equipment</a> for local law enforcement use in 2019, Boston police turned to Tactical Support Equipment.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>A Push to Regulate the Spy Technology</h3>
<p>The proliferation of this technology among local law enforcement departments across the country concerns civil rights advocates.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Kade Crockford, who heads the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, called the cell site simulator &ldquo;extremely invasive&rdquo; and was not surprised Boston police used forfeiture dollars to pay for it, which avoided scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>&ldquo;For a long time, law enforcement has been extremely secretive about their acquisition and use of this particular kind of technology,&rdquo; Crockford said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Knowing precisely how many are being used by law enforcement across the country is impossible. By 2014, federal law enforcement purchased 434 devices totaling more than $95 million, according to a <a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/US-CellSiteSimulatorsPrivacy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">congressional oversight committee</a>. The ACLU reported a few years later that 75 local departments and state police also had the equipment in their hands.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p>Facing nationwide controversy about the stingray, legislators at the federal, state and local level want more oversight of how cell site simulators are purchased and some demand police get a warrant from a judge.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>In June, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/W000779-ron-wyden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.</a>, co-sponsored a bipartisan bill called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2122/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cell-Site Simulator Warrant Act of 2021</a>, which would require a warrant to use the technology except in cases of emergencies. It would also require federal law enforcement agencies to provide annual reports about how the devices were used.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>&ldquo;Cell site simulators have existed in a kind of legal no-man&rsquo;s land for far too long,&rdquo; Wyden said in a statement when the legislation was introduced. The bill, he said, replaces &ldquo;secrecy and uncertainty ... with clear, transparent rules for when the government can use these invasive surveillance devices.&rdquo;</p>
        
    
                    
<p>As of 2016, California was the only known state that requires city councils to approve written police procedures for use of stingrays before purchasing.</p>

<p>But even with that regulation in place, at least one police department tried to avoid the new rules.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>A privacy advocacy group sued the city of Vallejo after the city <a href="https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2020/03/25/vallejo-purchases-cell-site-simulator-for-police-department/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved the purchase of a $766,000 cell site simulator</a> in March 2020 without adopting a use policy. After a judge determined the city violated state law, the city required the <a href="https://www.cityofvallejo.net/common/pages/DisplayFile.aspx?itemId=16619943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vallejo police</a> to obtain a search warrant before using the technology, or immediately after in the case of an &ldquo;exigent&rdquo; or emergency situation involving the threat of physical harm or death.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>From 2009-16, Boston police <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2016/07/27/local-news/boston-police-use-cellphone-trackers-without-warrants-raises-questions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never obtained a warrant</a>, claiming exigent circumstances when using a cell site simulator, a practice the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclum.org/en/press-releases/boston-police-documents-reveal-use-cell-phone-surveillance-without-warrant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heavily criticized</a>.</p>

<p>Legislators in Massachusetts have tried pushing for more oversight of stingrays. In 2019, while the BPD was purchasing the new cell site simulator, legislation was pending for two electronic privacy bills. They would have limited the use of cell site simulators and required warrants in most cases. Both bills died in committee.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>That same year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court <a href="http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/482/482mass35.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled that</a> real-time surveillance of a person&rsquo;s cellphone constitutes a search under the state&rsquo;s Constitution and therefore requires a warrant, except in &ldquo;exigent&rdquo; circumstances.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Federal courts in Oakland, California, and New York City, as well as a Maryland state appellate court, also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/09/21/police-use-of-stingray-cellphone-tracker-requires-search-warrant-appeals-court-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled</a> that police use of spy technology is a violation of the Fourth Amendment right not to be unreasonably searched without a court-ordered warrant.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>WBUR asked Boston police spokesman Boyle what policies and procedures the department has for the use of the powerful and controversial technology. He said it has none.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>He said that according to internal investigative reports, there have been 98 instances since 2017 in which BPD has used a cell site simulator. Forty-one of those, he said, involved &ldquo;exigent&rdquo; circumstances in which a warrant wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p>Boyle also confirmed that BPD&rsquo;s equipment is capable of collecting identifying information from cellphones in the area that are not being actively investigated. According to Boyle, that information is &ldquo;discarded.&rdquo;</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Shedding Light on How Money Is Spent</h3>
<p>The details of how this technology is purchased and operated by Boston police fall mostly outside of the public&rsquo;s view, but the City Council is trying to change that.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Arroyo is a co-sponsor of a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/10/21/boston-new-police-surveillance-technology-approval-required" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new city ordinance</a> barring BPD from acquiring new surveillance technology without first receiving approval from the city council.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The current system, Arroyo said, is &ldquo;just a bunch of folks in a room somewhere saying, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to buy this, or we&rsquo;re going to move on that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There have been efforts at the state level to insert more transparency into the spending of civil forfeiture dollars.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The criminal justice reform act passed in 2018 mandated, for the first time, that Massachusetts district attorneys file annual reports to the state treasurer&rsquo;s office on how they spent their share of proceeds from civil forfeitures. The law also references that similar reports be created by police departments, but its interpretation varies. WBUR found only two out of more than 350 police departments in the state had filed reports with the office since 2018.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>In an email sent days after it became law, Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes, head of the Massachusetts Major City Chiefs of Police Association, instructed more than 100 law enforcement officers from departments across the state to comply with the new reporting requirements &ldquo;effective immediately.&rdquo; Nonetheless, some police departments told WBUR they thought it was voluntary.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p>When WBUR asked Boston police whether it files expenditures to the state, BPD said it would begin doing so.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Livingstone, the state representative who helped write the statute, said he believed police departments had been filing forfeiture spending reports to the treasurer&rsquo;s office, until WBUR informed him that&rsquo;s not the case. &ldquo;It is incredibly disappointing to learn that police departments have just decided not to provide any information to the public,&rdquo; Livingstone said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>He said the only long-term remedy is taking forfeiture dollars out of the hands of law enforcement and rerouting them into the state&rsquo;s general fund. &ldquo;Having these systems where police departments or DAs are nickel and diming some of the poorest people in the state to create this slush fund that they can use for whatever they want, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.&rdquo;</p>

 <p><span>Screenshots of Phishing SMSs reported to Citizen Lab in 2016</span></p>

 <p><span>The target was only hacked when they clicked the link, a technique known as a one-click exploit. Recently, however, it has been documented that NSO is offering their clients zero-click exploitation technology, where even very technically savvy targets who might not click a phishing link are completely unaware they are being targeted. In the zero-click scenario no user interaction is required. Meaning, t</span><span>he attacker doesn't need to send phishing messages; the exploit just works silently in the background</span><span>. Short of not using a device, t</span><span>here is no way to prevent exploitation by a zero-click exploit; it's a weapon against which there is no defense</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>One weird trick</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The initial entry point for Pegasus on iPhone is iMessage. This means that a victim can be targeted just using their phone number or AppleID username.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>iMessage has native support for GIF images, the typically small and low quality animated images popular in meme culture. You can send and receive GIFs in iMessage chats and they show up in the chat window. Apple wanted to make those GIFs loop endlessly rather than only play once, so very early on in the </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-look-at-imessage-in-ios-14.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iMessage parsing and processing pipeline</a></span><span>&nbsp;(after a message has been received but well before the message is shown), iMessage calls the following method in the </span><span>IMTranscoderAgent</span><span>&nbsp;process</span><span>&nbsp;(outside the "BlastDoor" sandbox), passing any image file received with the extension </span><span>.gif</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>&nbsp; [IMGIFUtils copyGifFromPath:toDestinationPath:error]</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Looking at the selector name, the intention here was probably to just copy the GIF file before editing the loop count field, but the semantics of this method are different. Under the hood it uses the CoreGraphics APIs to </span><span>render</span><span>&nbsp;the source image to a </span><span>new</span><span>&nbsp;GIF file at the destination path. And just because the source filename has to end in </span><span>.gif</span><span>, that doesn't mean it's really a GIF file.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The ImageIO library, </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/04/fuzzing-imageio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as detailed in a previous Project Zero blogpost</a></span><span>, is used to guess the correct format of the source file and parse it, completely ignoring the file extension. Using this "fake gif" trick, over 20 image codecs are suddenly part of the iMessage zero-click attack surface, including some very obscure and complex formats, remotely exposing probably hundreds of thousands of lines of code. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>Note: Apple inform us that they have restricted the available ImageIO formats reachable from IMTranscoderAgent starting in iOS 14.8.1 (26 October 2021), and completely removed the GIF code path from IMTranscoderAgent starting in iOS 15.0 (20 September 2021), with GIF decoding taking place entirely within BlastDoor.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A PDF in your GIF</span></p>
 
 <p><span>NSO uses the "fake gif" trick to target a vulnerability in the CoreGraphics PDF parser.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>PDF was a popular target for exploitation around a decade ago, due to its ubiquity and complexity. Plus, the availability of javascript inside PDFs made development of reliable exploits far easier. The CoreGraphics PDF parser doesn't </span><span>seem</span><span>&nbsp;to interpret javascript, but NSO managed to find something equally powerful inside the CoreGraphics PDF parser...</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Extreme compression</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In the late 1990's, bandwidth and storage were much more scarce than they are now. It was in that environment that the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JBIG2</a></span><span>&nbsp;standard emerged. JBIG2 is a domain specific image codec designed to compress images where pixels can only be black or white.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It was developed to achieve extremely high compression ratios for scans of text documents and was implemented and used in high-end office scanner/printer devices like the XEROX WorkCenter device shown below. If you used the </span><span>scan to pdf</span><span>&nbsp;functionality of a device like this a decade ago, your PDF likely had a JBIG2 stream in it.</span><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWZdMTUZfcCmxvlf99Hl9jE1A8OcfR-sD3kZR8xpOpwh05MFzQCfcDFIgLxDV_KalZHhqUIxKJ-YCHMSG3PGzPQq-FQYt3PhbycGxxqzljUCllSuZQsT4CEri977oV9jiS3pdCmu4Dmj3uzdEU2RlZgol--aaAdapWwid0C3xxo-kNhjdZs91-6WWLQQ=s700" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWZdMTUZfcCmxvlf99Hl9jE1A8OcfR-sD3kZR8xpOpwh05MFzQCfcDFIgLxDV_KalZHhqUIxKJ-YCHMSG3PGzPQq-FQYt3PhbycGxxqzljUCllSuZQsT4CEri977oV9jiS3pdCmu4Dmj3uzdEU2RlZgol--aaAdapWwid0C3xxo-kNhjdZs91-6WWLQQ=s700" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></span></p>
 <p><span>A Xerox WorkCentre 7500 series multifunction printer, which used JBIG2</span></p>
 <p><span>for its scan-to-pdf functionality</span></p>
 <p><span>source: </span><span><a href="https://www.office.xerox.com/en-us/multifunction-printers/workcentre-7545-7556/specifications" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.office.xerox.com/en-us/multifunction-printers/workcentre-7545-7556/specifications</a></span></p>
 
 <p><span>The PDFs files produced by those scanners were exceptionally small, perhaps only a few kilobytes. There are two novel techniques which JBIG2 uses to achieve these extreme compression ratios which are relevant to this exploit:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Technique</span><span>&nbsp;1: </span><span>Segmentation and substitution</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Effectively every text document, especially those written in languages with small alphabets like English or German, consists of many repeated letters (also known as </span><span>glyphs</span><span>) on each page. JBIG2 tries to segment each page into glyphs then uses simple pattern matching to match up glyphs which look the same:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh6iNZLjmFtsjnVl7fWtG-Kq-TEw3azo1lwXKtyz-TNDRRQclfYG7p2tsSIoKJOKfhsBqSRDbJZ6gWH9K_7HeDpziuugHYegXG4Va111UEsCuBquBwf2BarcQIYFymNUlYS9d7YWHaSCLOO3BreLN6BT2V_Wj7flT9TjkpjaM_XtADdhrRN4Jy5b5qT_Q=s352" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh6iNZLjmFtsjnVl7fWtG-Kq-TEw3azo1lwXKtyz-TNDRRQclfYG7p2tsSIoKJOKfhsBqSRDbJZ6gWH9K_7HeDpziuugHYegXG4Va111UEsCuBquBwf2BarcQIYFymNUlYS9d7YWHaSCLOO3BreLN6BT2V_Wj7flT9TjkpjaM_XtADdhrRN4Jy5b5qT_Q=s352" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></span></p>
 <p><span>Simple pattern matching can find all the shapes which look similar on a page,</span></p>
 <p><span>in this case all the 'e's</span></p>
 
 <p><span>JBIG2 doesn't actually know anything about glyphs and it isn't doing OCR (optical character recognition.) A JBIG encoder is just looking for connected regions of pixels and grouping similar looking regions together. The compression algorithm is to simply substitute all </span><span>sufficiently-similar</span><span>&nbsp;looking regions with a copy of just one of them:</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgxM5VTCT6dKeMRITKT6kQDsQue8Py7eRGUYA045MkuaO9VagUeisKMa195020OTUHVSpDpI39qm8v5ZNG54OLNHwEfmuskR13PiIKAAAyBpoW0KnW2G3rncfSO4LC_b5zxDVTW0heCEaXEW95UHfwM7LZ2il-tonGDRHc6BQDhJ1rsYgRg_VbwSBefvQ=s327" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgxM5VTCT6dKeMRITKT6kQDsQue8Py7eRGUYA045MkuaO9VagUeisKMa195020OTUHVSpDpI39qm8v5ZNG54OLNHwEfmuskR13PiIKAAAyBpoW0KnW2G3rncfSO4LC_b5zxDVTW0heCEaXEW95UHfwM7LZ2il-tonGDRHc6BQDhJ1rsYgRg_VbwSBefvQ=s327" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></span></p>
 <p><span>Replacing all occurrences of similar glyphs with a copy of just one often yields a document which is still quite legible and enables very high compression ratios</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In this case the output is perfectly readable but the amount of information to be stored is significantly reduced. Rather than needing to store all the original pixel information for the whole page you only need a compressed version of the "reference glyph" for each character and the relative coordinates of all the places where copies should be made. The decompression algorithm then treats the output page like a canvas and "draws" the exact same glyph at all the stored locations.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>There's a significant issue with such a scheme: it's far too easy for a poor encoder to accidentally swap similar looking characters, and this can happen with interesting consequences. </span><span><a href="http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D. Kriesel's blog has some motivating examples</a></span><span>&nbsp;where PDFs of scanned invoices have different figures or PDFs of scanned construction drawings end up with incorrect measurements. These aren't the issues we're looking at, but they are one significant reason why JBIG2 is not a common compression format anymore.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Technique </span><span>2: </span><span>Refinement coding</span></p>
 
 <p><span>As mentioned above, the substitution based compression output is lossy. After a round of compression and decompression the rendered output doesn't look exactly like the input. But JBIG2 also supports lossless compression as well as an intermediate "less lossy" compression mode.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It does this by also storing (and compressing) the </span><span>difference</span><span>&nbsp;between the substituted glyph and each original glyph. Here's an example showing a difference mask between a substituted character on the left and the original lossless character in the middle:</span></p>
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJn4fCqItjd3bgJ_re3nMHB4aFgaR-17H6lGyPUDTdtmFAIO59Pg8WDxIYjBu_9cAFL_7fLp47YQBCzw5xiv-PdevPiJ0lyYdSvyMXrgpm45vnOtGrhjFgvRKoeVe9T8iIdZaHXFc8plsJm5QFYUop4cfcqklaYmr62HjOze-ZbA2GB4HGmXflhyF9_A=s267" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJn4fCqItjd3bgJ_re3nMHB4aFgaR-17H6lGyPUDTdtmFAIO59Pg8WDxIYjBu_9cAFL_7fLp47YQBCzw5xiv-PdevPiJ0lyYdSvyMXrgpm45vnOtGrhjFgvRKoeVe9T8iIdZaHXFc8plsJm5QFYUop4cfcqklaYmr62HjOze-ZbA2GB4HGmXflhyF9_A=s267" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></span></p>
 <p><span>Using the XOR operator on bitmaps to compute a difference image</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In this simple example the encoder can store the difference mask shown on the right, then during decompression the difference mask can be XORed with the substituted character to recover the exact pixels making up the original character. There are some more tricks outside of the scope of this blog post to further compress that difference mask using the intermediate forms of the substituted character as a "context" for the compression.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Rather than completely encoding the entire difference in one go, it can be done in steps, with each iteration using a logical operator (one of AND, OR, XOR or XNOR) to set, clear or flip bits. Each successive refinement step brings the rendered output closer to the original and this allows a level of control over the "</span><span>lossiness</span><span>" of the compression. The implementation of these refinement coding steps is very flexible and they are also able to "read" values already present on the output canvas.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A JBIG2 stream</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Most of the CoreGraphics PDF decoder appears to be Apple proprietary code, but the JBIG2 implementation is from Xpdf, </span><span><a href="https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the source code for which is freely available</a></span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The JBIG2 format is a series of segments, which can be thought of as a series of drawing commands which are executed sequentially in a single pass. The CoreGraphics JBIG2 parser supports 19 different segment types which include operations like defining a new page, decoding a huffman table or rendering a bitmap to given coordinates on the page.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Segments are represented by the class </span><span>JBIG2Segment</span><span>&nbsp;and its subclasses </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>JBIG2SymbolDict</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;represents a rectangular array of pixels. Its </span><span>data</span><span>&nbsp;field points to a backing-buffer containing the rendering canvas.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A </span><span>JBIG2SymbolDict</span><span>&nbsp;groups </span><span>JBIG2Bitmaps</span><span>&nbsp;together. The destination page is represented as a </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>, as are individual glyphs.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>JBIG2Segments</span><span>&nbsp;can be referred to by a segment number and the </span><span>GList</span><span>&nbsp;vector type stores pointers to all the </span><span>JBIG2Segments</span><span>. To look up a segment by segment number the </span><span>GList</span><span>&nbsp;is scanned sequentially.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The vulnerability</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The vulnerability is a classic integer overflow when collating referenced segments:</span></p>
 <div colspan="1" rowspan="1">
 <p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Guint numSyms; // (1)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>&nbsp; numSyms = 0;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; nRefSegs; ++i) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if ((seg = findSegment(refSegs[i]))) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (seg-&gt;getType() == jbig2SegSymbolDict) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>numSyms += ((JBIG2SymbolDict *)seg)-&gt;getSize(); &nbsp;// (2)</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (seg-&gt;getType() == jbig2SegCodeTable) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; codeTables-&gt;append(seg);</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; } else {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; error(errSyntaxError, getPos(),</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Invalid segment reference in JBIG2 text region");</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delete codeTables;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; // get the symbol bitmaps</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>syms = (</span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;**)gmallocn(numSyms, sizeof(</span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;*)); // (3)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>&nbsp; kk = 0;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; for (i = 0; i &lt; nRefSegs; ++i) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if ((seg = findSegment(refSegs[i]))) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (seg-&gt;getType() == jbig2SegSymbolDict) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; symbolDict = (JBIG2SymbolDict *)seg;</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (k = 0; k &lt; symbolDict-&gt;getSize(); ++k) {</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>syms[kk++] = symbolDict-&gt;getBitmap(k); // (4)</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span></p>
 <p><span>&nbsp; }</span></p></div>
 
 <p><span>numSyms</span><span>&nbsp;is a 32-bit integer declared at </span><span>(1)</span><span>. By supplying carefully crafted </span><span>reference segments</span><span>&nbsp;it's possible for the repeated addition at </span><span>(2)</span><span>&nbsp;to cause </span><span>numSyms</span><span>&nbsp;to overflow to a controlled, small value.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>That smaller value is used for the heap allocation size at </span><span>(3)</span><span>&nbsp;meaning </span><span>syms</span><span>&nbsp;points to an undersized buffer.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Inside the inner-most loop at </span><span>(4)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;pointer values are written into the undersized </span><span>syms</span><span>&nbsp;buffer.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Without another trick this loop would write over 32GB of data into the undersized </span><span>syms</span><span>&nbsp;buffer, certainly causing a crash. To avoid that crash the heap is groomed such that the first few writes off of the end of the </span><span>syms</span><span>&nbsp;buffer corrupt the </span><span>GList</span><span>&nbsp;backing buffer. This </span><span>GList</span><span>&nbsp;stores all known segments and is used by the </span><span>findSegments</span><span>&nbsp;routine to map from the segment numbers passed in </span><span>refSegs</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span>JBIG2Segment</span><span>&nbsp;pointers. The overflow causes the JBIG2Segment pointers in the GList to be overwritten with </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;pointers at </span><span>(4)</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Conveniently since </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;inherits from </span><span>JBIG2Segment</span><span>&nbsp;the </span><span>seg-&gt;getType()</span><span>&nbsp;virtual call succeed even on devices where Pointer Authentication is enabled (which is used to perform a weak type check on virtual calls) but the returned type will now </span><span>not</span><span>&nbsp;be equal to </span><span>jbig2SegSymbolDict</span><span>&nbsp;thus causing further writes at </span><span>(4)</span><span>&nbsp;to not be reached and bounding the extent of the memory corruption</span><span>.</span></p>

This overwrites the vtable pointer and the first four fields of the </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;representing the current page.</span><span>&nbsp;Due to the nature of the iOS address space layout these pointers are very likely to be in the second 4GB of virtual memory, with addresses between </span><span>0x100000000</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>0x1ffffffff</span><span>. Since all iOS hardware is little endian (meaning that the </span><span>w</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>line</span><span>&nbsp;fields are likely to be overwritten with </span><span>0x1</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span>the most-significant half of a </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;pointer) and the </span><span>segNum</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>h</span><span>&nbsp;fields are likely to be overwritten with the least-significant half of such a pointer, a fairly random value depending on heap layout and ASLR somewhere between </span><span>0x100000</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>0xffffffff</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This gives the current destination page </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;an unknown, but very large, value for </span><span>h</span><span>. Since that </span><span>h</span><span>&nbsp;value is used for bounds checking and is supposed to reflect the allocated size of the page backing buffer, this has the effect of "unbounding" the drawing canvas. This means that subsequent </span><span>JBIG2</span><span>&nbsp;segment commands can read and write memory outside of the original bounds of the page backing buffer.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The heap groom also places the current page's backing buffer just below the undersized </span><span>syms</span><span>&nbsp;buffer, such that when the page </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;is unbounded, it's able to </span><span>read and write</span><span>&nbsp;its own fields:</span></p>

 <p><span>The memory layout showing how the unbounded bitmap backing buffer is able to reference the JBIG2Bitmap object and modify fields in it as it is located after the backing buffer in memory</span></p>
 
 <p><span>By rendering 4-byte bitmaps at the correct canvas coordinates they can write to all the fields of the page </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;and b</span><span>y carefully choosing new values for </span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>h</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>line</span><span>, </span><span>they can write to arbitrary offsets from the page backing buffer.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>At this point it would also be possible to write to arbitrary absolute memory addresses if you knew their offsets from the page backing buffer. But how to compute those offsets? Thus far, this exploit has proceeded in a manner very similar to a "canonical" scripting language exploit which in Javascript might end up with an unbounded ArrayBuffer object with access to memory. But in those cases the attacker has the ability to run arbitrary Javascript which can obviously be used to compute offsets and perform arbitrary computations. How do you do that in a single-pass image parser?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>My other compression format is turing-complete!</span></p>
 
 <p><span>As mentioned earlier, the sequence of steps which implement JBIG2 refinement are very flexible. Refinement steps can reference both the output bitmap and any previously created segments, as well as render output to either the current page or a segment. By carefully crafting the context-dependent part of the refinement decompression, it's possible to craft sequences of segments where only the refinement combination operators have any effect.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In practice this means it is possible to apply the AND, OR, XOR and XNOR logical operators between memory regions at arbitrary offsets from the current page's </span><span>JBIG2Bitmap</span><span>&nbsp;backing buffer. And since that has been unbounded&hellip; it's possible to perform those logical operations on memory at arbitrary out-of-bounds offsets:</span></p>

 <p><span>The memory layout showing how logical operators can be applied out-of-bounds</span></p>
 
 <p><span>It's when you take this to its most extreme form that things start to get really interesting. What if rather than operating on glyph-sized sub-rectangles you instead operated on single bits?</span></p>
 
 <p><span>You can now provide as input a sequence of JBIG2 segment commands which implement a sequence of logical bit operations to apply to the page. And since the page buffer has been unbounded those bit operations can operate on arbitrary memory.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>With a bit of back-of-the-envelope scribbling you can convince yourself that with just the available AND, OR, XOR and XNOR logical</span><span>&nbsp;operators</span><span>&nbsp;you can in fact compute </span><span>any</span><span>&nbsp;computable function - the simplest proof being that you can create a logical NOT operator by XORing with 1 and then putting an AND gate in front of that to form a NAND gate:</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgU2PbU_PLrLOH1W-ZuOIC0aR5iOEt3iJonIHUpsf4PxyWoyfGF3xoOMaMUtpgvGNWenhWFe4ER31RQuB4_ikNt6qnYpYmmigtRziR192B3G-qHOqza5Wjm0DnkOk9a4TJLRBegZvk8E1nSJuDelFRHrzgGEq2p_6wIts5zeBXzzuqVU8p0qlK--cscGw=s265" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgU2PbU_PLrLOH1W-ZuOIC0aR5iOEt3iJonIHUpsf4PxyWoyfGF3xoOMaMUtpgvGNWenhWFe4ER31RQuB4_ikNt6qnYpYmmigtRziR192B3G-qHOqza5Wjm0DnkOk9a4TJLRBegZvk8E1nSJuDelFRHrzgGEq2p_6wIts5zeBXzzuqVU8p0qlK--cscGw=s265" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></span></p>
 <p><span>An AND gate connected to one input of an XOR gate. The other XOR gate input is connected to the constant value 1 creating an NAND.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>A NAND gate is an example of a universal logic gate; one from which all other gates can be built and from which a circuit can be </span><span><a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built to compute any computable function</a></span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Practical circuits</span></p>
 
 <p><span>JBIG2 doesn't have scripting capabilities, but when combined with a vulnerability, it does have the ability to emulate circuits of arbitrary logic gates operating on arbitrary memory. So why not just use that to build your </span><span>own</span><span>&nbsp;computer architecture and script that!? That's exactly what this exploit does. Using over 70,000 segment commands defining logical bit operations, they define a small computer architecture with features such as registers and a full 64-bit adder and comparator which they use to search memory and perform arithmetic operations. It's not as fast as Javascript, but it's fundamentally computationally equivalent</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The bootstrapping operations for the sandbox escape exploit are written to run on this logic circuit and the whole thing runs in this weird, emulated environment created out of a single decompression pass through a JBIG2 stream. It's pretty incredible, and at the same time, pretty terrifying.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>In a future post (currently being finished),</span><span>&nbsp;we'll take a look at exactly how they escape the </span><span>IMTranscoderAgent</span><span>&nbsp;sandbox.</span></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>We couldn't find any working library which could provide us with detecting phone position in 3d to make drawings that would fit our needs. Thus, we have created our OWN ORIGINAL SOLUTION by doing some hardcore R&amp;D magic.  Enjoy. You can fork this repo and use the underlying implementation from here to develop your own apps with point/move-your-phone-to-draw feature.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Our aim is to provide an experience where you master Harry Potter spells through practicing to draw them with your mobile phones. However, we did not take a simple approach, and instead made it possible through moving/rotating your phones, rather than drawing by hand.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea is that we could use Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Magnetometer sensors inside mobile phones to detect rotation, displacement, etc. of the phone. Using these data, we could create estimated drawings on a 2D plane. Finally, that drawing can be matched with original spell shape to decide whether you have successfully cast the spell!</p>
<p dir="auto">It required a huge R&amp;D effort for us; however, we have managed to accomplish them all. Let me explain how it works for you!</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://github.com#different-types-of-sensor-data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>Different Types of Sensor Data</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Firstly, we have collected all available sensor data from our mobile devices, and plotted them on real-time scatter plots. Next up, we have taken first and second derivative as well as first and second degree integral of these data, and also plotted these in these scatter plots.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To reproduce, use <a href="https://github.com/corupta/wander-test-dashboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@corupta/wander-test-dashboard</a> in combination with an old version of mobile app dedicated to this testing process <a href="https://github.com/corupta/wander-app/tree/sensor-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@corupta/wander-app sensor-test branch</a></li>
<li>After running the dashboard (which opens up a socket.io server to collect data from mobile) in combination with that mobile version, you can do below:</li>
<li>Within this dashboard, if you go to 2d page, you can see all data plotted in real-time.</li>
<li>Again, in the dashboard you can go to 3d pages to see how some selected data is plotted in 3d.</li>
<li>Finally, if you go to 3dgl page, you can see a 3d to 2d mapped plot. It works, stable enough in my opinion, I COULD LITERALLY WRITE MY NAME USING MY PHONE AS A LASER POINTER.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto"><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://github.com#how-to-get-2d-plots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>How to get 2D plots?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The idea is if you use x and z values of gyroscope data and take its double integral, this is a good estimation of the relative movement of your phone which can be used as a laser pointer prediction.</li>
<li>However, the data is super noisy, and integrals diverge to infinity as a result.</li>
<li>We found a very interesting way to fix that issue. Think of the nuclear physics where particles have half-decay time. We applied a similar idea such that we always multiplied values with a decay ratio. If we keep this value high enough, everything worked super smoothly in an unexpected way. But that was not the only parameter we tried, and we weren't sure if this was possible at the beginning of the hackathon.</li>
<li>Doing above, we get a list of points in 2d, which can be used to create successful 2d drawings</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto"><a aria-hidden="true" href="https://github.com#image-similarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>Image Similarity</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We then compared two images (original spell shape image) by taking some kind of hashes via <code>Jimp</code> and obtained a similarity metric.</li>

<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, with the final feature we develop our server limit of 50MB for source code was finished (our source code built became 51MB)
So, we tried to deploy it to aws server in the last minute and it took some time. As a result we couldn't test this feature.
There are tiny typo bugs regarding this feature, and can be fixed by applying patch from <a href="https://gist.github.com/okaygenc/82e629f1923bf274b38edc54c92dcc33" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wander-app-after-hackathon.patch</a> to this repo.
They will be committed to this repo after the hackathon evaluations end.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>To do so, download <a href="https://gist.github.com/okaygenc/82e629f1923bf274b38edc54c92dcc33" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wander-app-after-hackathon.patch</a> to repo main folder</li>
<li>Type <code>git apply wander-app-after-hackathon.patch</code></li>
<li>Now, the repo should be patched correctly.</li>
<li>Patch files are git diff results obtained by <code>git diff</code> You can google it to get to know it more.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Another version (AWS one) including this patch is deployed on <a href="https://api2.wanderapp.cf/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://api2.wanderapp.cf/docs</a> with the new feature working as well.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29535345" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><section><p>More people have come forward to claim they were<span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hertz-customers-allege-false-arrests-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> accused, arrested or even jailed after Hertz reported cars</a></span>&nbsp;they had legitimately rented were stolen. &nbsp;</p>

    

<p>Carrie Gibbs was arrested at a California gas station in 2019 after Hertz told police she'd stolen the truck.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The truck had been rented for her from Hertz by an insurance company after an accident, but video obtained exclusively by CBS News shows police arresting her.&nbsp; They took her to jail, and she was charged with felony car theft. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The case was later dismissed but Gibbs said in court papers she lost her real estate license for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've been a real estate agent for 18 years. So this is the most frustrating thing ever," Gibbs told CBS News' consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner.&nbsp;</p><p>A NASA employee claims he was also targeted after Hertz reported his vehicle stolen. In court papers, he said he was driving a rented Hertz SUV when Florida police officers held him at gun point after Hertz filed a theft report two days earlier, claiming the vehicle NASA had rented was stolen. CBS News obtained video of the arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>He was later released and not charged and has also filed a claim against the rental company. &nbsp;</p><p>Another claimant, Florida banker Manuel Garcia, said he watched as his Hertz rental car was towed away while he was at a restaurant after it was also reported it stolen&mdash;even though he said he had been leasing the car for months.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"Never in my life would I imagine that I would be in a situation like this," Garcia said. &nbsp;</p><p>Carmen Bosko rented a car from a Florida Hertz location in January and said she returned it in April. But in August, officers in Georgia arrested her for car theft. Bosko spent 40 days in jail and was separated from her three children including her two-month-old baby. &nbsp;</p><p>"I had to explain to my kids why I was gone for 40 days. And I missed time with my youngest that I'll never get back," she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steven Robinson told CBS News he never even rented a car from Hertz. But in June, police arrested him for car theft. He spent two days in jail and is now being prosecuted on felony charges. &nbsp;</p><p>"I mean, this was the worst experience ever in my life. And I can't believe that Hertz and it was a good slogan I heard, but Hertz really hurts people. Their negligent practices is like, it's terrible," said Robinson. &nbsp;</p><p>Another person, Rejeana Meado, said she rented a Hertz car for three days in May to attend a wedding in Houston with her husband. She claims she returned it on time. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>But last week, Hertz sent her this email saying they have now reported the car stolen, meaning she could face charges and now lives in fear she will be arrested. &nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>"I have a husband. I have kids. It's terrible. Sorry... My doorbell rings and I am fearful that it is the cops coming to get me," Meado said. &nbsp;</p><p>Hertz declined to comment for this story but has previously said the "vast majority" of cases "involve renters who were many weeks or even months overdue returning vehicles and who stopped communicating with (Hertz) well beyond the scheduled due date."</p><p>There are now 191 claims filed in federal bankruptcy court on behalf of people who say they were falsely arrested. &nbsp;</p><p>As CBS News has previously reported, the Delaware bankruptcy court judge is currently considering how many of those claims can move forward.&nbsp; Attorney Francis Alexander Malofiy said since CBS News' report first aired, more people are coming forward.</p><p>"People think that they're an isolated incident and they don't realize that this is a systemic issue that's happening across the nation," Malofiy said. &nbsp;</p><p>Hertz disputes that, saying "situations where vehicles are reported to the authorities are very rare."&nbsp;</p><p>Fritz Jekel filed a similar case in 2019 and at the time asked Hertz whether there were any other lawsuits for false arrests and similar claims. He said he got back a database, containing over 300 claims filed, going all the way back to 2008-2016.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>CBS News was not able to view the database because Hertz has marked it confidential. Hertz did not answer our questions about that database. &nbsp;</p><p>In a previous statement, Hertz said it "cares deeply about our customers, and we successfully provide rental vehicles for tens of millions of travelers each year."&nbsp;</p><p>Hertz Statement: (November 2, 2021)</p><p><em>Hertz cares deeply about our customers, and we successfully provide rental vehicles for tens of millions of travelers each year. Unfortunately, in the legal matters being discussed, the attorneys have a track record of making baseless claims that blatantly misrepresent the facts. The vast majority of these cases involve renters who were many weeks or even months overdue returning vehicles and who stopped communicating with us well beyond the scheduled due date. Situations where vehicles are reported to the authorities are very rare and happen only after exhaustive attempts to reach the customer.</em></p>

            <p>A few years ago we covered the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/oracle-cloud-gets-an-always-free-tier/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oracle Cloud Gets an Always Free Tier</a>. Previously, one would get two AMD EPYC based compute VMs with 1/8 OCPU and 1GB of memory each. Let us call that what it is, not much. The bonus though is that, unlike the AWS Free Tier, this is an Always Free tier. Now, Oracle is upping the ante (significantly) with its new Ampere Arm A1 offering.<span></span></p>
<h2>Oracle Cloud Giving Away Ampere Arm A1 Instances Always Free</h2>
<p>Although this has been announced for some time, the Oracle Cloud Ampere Altra offering is finally live. One can see that in the list of available &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; we have a bare-metal machine offering. These machines each have two Ampere Altra 80 core 3.0GHz CPUs. Beyond that, there is 100Gbps networking and 1TB of memory.</p>

<p>Why you are likely here though is due to the virtual machine. One can see this is Always Free Eligible. We can select the Ampere instance which is on the main Shapes listing not as a &ldquo;specialty&rdquo; instance type. Here we can make a VM.Standard.A1.Flex instance.</p>

<p>Flex allows one to configure the amount of CPU and memory in an instance. In the Always Free tier, we get four cores and up to 24GB of memory so, in theory, we could make smaller instances. Still, we decided to go big and make one large instance.</p>

<p>Above, you can see the quad-core Ampere Altra (A1) Arm instance with just over 46GB of storage and 24GB of memory. The overall setup takes minutes to get running.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>To us, this is a big deal. This is perhaps one of the best &ldquo;free&rdquo; instances that one can get. Something that we really like about Oracle&rsquo;s Always Free tier is that one can use it without being as worried about overages as with Amazon&rsquo;s offering. AWS has a size advantage, but Oracle has a great Always Free Tier offering.</p>
<p>Beyond the free tier, the pricing on the A1 instances is very low. We get $0.01/ hr per core costs as well as $0.0015/GB per GB hour of memory.</p>

<p>That makes the instance we have, less storage, worth around $0.076/ hour. To put this another way, the Amazon AWS EC2 a1.xlarge has 4 cores and 8GB of memory for $0.102 on-demand so Oracle is offering 3x the memory at about a 25% discount over what Amazon is offering.</p>
<p>Expect more on this from STH in the near future. As always, you can learn more about <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-m128-30-128-core-arm-server-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ampere Altra on STH</a>.</p>

<p><em>After leaving The Washington Post in 1977,  Carl Bernstein  spent six months looking at the relationship  of the CIA  and the press  during the Cold War years.   His 25,000-word  cover story, published in Rolling Stone  on October 20, 1977, is reprinted  below. </em></p>
<p><strong>THE CIA AND THE MEDIA</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>How Americas Most Powerful  News Media Worked Hand in Glove with the Central Intelligence Agency and Why  the Church Committee Covered It Up</strong></em></p>
<p>BY CARL BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>In 1953, Joseph Alsop, then one of  America&rsquo;s leading syndicated columnists, went to the Philippines to cover an  election. He did not go because he was asked to do so by his syndicate. He did  not go because he was asked to do so by the newspapers that printed his column.  He went at the request of the CIA.</p>
<p>Alsop is one of  more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty&#8209;five years have  secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according  to documents on file at CIA headquarters. Some of these journalists&rsquo;  relationships with the Agency were tacit; some were explicit. There was  cooperation, accommodation and overlap. Journalists provided a full range of  clandestine services&mdash;from simple intelligence gathering to serving as go&#8209;betweens  with spies in Communist countries. Reporters shared their notebooks with the  CIA. Editors shared their staffs. Some of the journalists were Pulitzer Prize  winners, distinguished reporters who considered themselves ambassadors  without&#8209;portfolio for their country. Most were less exalted: foreign correspondents  who found that their association with the Agency helped their work; stringers  and freelancers who were as interested in the derring&#8209;do of the spy business as  in filing articles; and, the smallest category, full&#8209;time CIA employees  masquerading as journalists abroad. In many instances, CIA documents show,  journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the  managements of America&rsquo;s leading news organizations.</p>



<p>The history of the CIA&rsquo;s involvement with  the American press continues to be shrouded by an official policy of  obfuscation and deception for the following principal reasons:</p>
<p>&#9632; The use of journalists has been among the most productive  means of intelligence&#8209;gathering employed by the CIA. Although the Agency has  cut back sharply on the use of reporters since 1973 primarily as a result of  pressure from the media), some journalist&#8209;operatives are still posted abroad.</p>
<p>&#9632; Further investigation into the matter, CIA officials say,  would inevitably reveal a series of embarrassing relationships in the 1950s and  1960s with some of the most powerful organizations and  individuals in American journalism.</p>
<p>Among the executives who lent their  cooperation to the Agency were Williarn Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System, Henry Luce of Tirne Inc., Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the <em>New York Times</em>,  Barry Bingham Sr. of the <em>LouisviIle</em><em> Courier&#8209;Journal, </em>and James Copley of the Copley News Service. Other organizations which  cooperated with the CIA include the American Broadcasting Company, the National  Broadcasting Company, the Associated Press, United Press International,  Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps&#8209;Howard, <em>Newsweek </em>magazine, the  Mutual Broadcasting System, the <em>Miami Herald </em>and the old <em>Saturday  Evening Post</em> and <em>New York Herald&#8209;Tribune.</em></p>
<p>By far the most valuable of these  associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the <em>New York Times, </em>CBS and Time Inc.</p>
<p>The CIA&rsquo;s use of the American news media  has been much more extensive than Agency officials have acknowledged publicly  or in closed sessions with members of Congress. The general outlines of what  happened are indisputable; the specifics are harder to come by. CIA sources  hint that a particular journalist was trafficking all over Eastern Europe for  the Agency; the journalist says no, he just had lunch with the station chief.  CIA sources say flatly that a well&#8209;known ABC correspondent worked for the  Agency through 1973; they refuse to identify him. A high&#8209;level CIA official  with a prodigious memory says that the <em>New York Times </em>provided cover for  about ten CIA operatives between 1950 and 1966; he does not know who they were,  or who in the newspaper&rsquo;s management made the arrangements.</p>
<p>The Agency&rsquo;s special relationships with  the so&#8209;called &ldquo;majors&rdquo; in publishing and broadcasting enabled the CIA to post  some of its most valuable operatives abroad without exposure for more than two  decades. In most instances, Agency files show, officials at the highest levels  of the CIA usually director or deputy director) dealt personally with a single  designated individual in the top management of the  cooperating news organization. The aid furnished often took two forms:  providing jobs and credentials &ldquo;journalistic cover&rdquo; in Agency parlance) for CIA  operatives about to be posted in foreign capitals; and lending the Agency the  undercover services of reporters already on staff, including some of the best&#8209;known  correspondents in the business.</p>
<p>In the field, journalists were used to help recruit  and handle foreigners as agents; to acquire and evaluate information, and to  plant false information with officials of foreign governments. Many signed  secrecy agreements, pledging never to divulge anything about their dealings  with the Agency; some signed employment contracts.,  some were assigned case officers and treated with. unusual  deference. Others had less structured relationships with the Agency, even  though they performed similar tasks: they were briefed by CIA personnel before  trips abroad, debriefed afterward, and used as intermediaries with foreign  agents. Appropriately, the CIA uses the term &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; to describe much of  what cooperating journalists did for the Agency. &ldquo;We would ask them, &lsquo;Will you  do us a favor?&rsquo;&rdquo;.said a  senior CIA official. &ldquo;&lsquo;We understand you&rsquo;re going to be in Yugoslavia. Have  they paved all the streets? Where did you see planes? Were there any signs of  military presence? How many Soviets did you see? If you happen to meet a  Soviet, get his name and spell it right .... Can you  set up a meeting for is? Or relay a message?&rsquo;&rdquo; Many CIA officials regarded  these helpful journalists as operatives; the journalists tended to see  themselves as trusted friends of the Agency who performed occasional favors&mdash;usually  without pay&mdash;in the national interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud they asked me and proud to have done  it,&rdquo; said Joseph Alsop who, like his late brother,  columnist Stewart Alsop, undertook clandestine tasks  for the Agency. &ldquo;The notion that a newspaperman doesn&rsquo;t have a duty to his  country is perfect balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Agency&rsquo;s perspective, there is  nothing untoward in such relationships, and any ethical questions are a matter  for the journalistic profession to resolve, not the intelligence community. As  Stuart Loory, former <em>Los Angeles Times</em> correspondent, has written in the<em> Columbia</em> <em>Journalism Review: &lsquo;</em>If  even one American overseas carrying a press card is a paid informer for the  CIA, then all Americans with those credentials are suspect .... If the crisis of  confidence faced by the news business&mdash;along with the government&mdash;is to be  overcome, journalists must be willing to focus on themselves the same spotlight  they so relentlessly train on others!&rsquo; But as Loory  also noted: &ldquo;When it was reported... that newsmen themselves were on the  payroll of the CIA, the story caused a brief stir, and then was dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the 1976 investigation of the CIA  by the Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, the  dimensions of the Agency&rsquo;s involvement with the press became apparent to  several members of the panel, as well as to two or three investigators on the  staff. But top officials of the CIA, including former directors William Colby  and George Bush, persuaded the committee to restrict its inquiry into the  matter and to deliberately misrepresent the actual scope of the activities in  its final report. The multivolurne report contains  nine pages in which the use of journalists is discussed in deliberately vague  and sometimes misleading terms. It makes no mention of the actual number of  journalists who undertook covert tasks for the CIA. Nor does it adequately  describe the role played by newspaper and broadcast executives in cooperating  with the Agency.</p>
<p>THE AGENCY&rsquo;S DEALINGS WITH THE PRESS BEGAN during the  earliest stages of the Cold War. Allen Dulles, who became director of the CIA  in 1953, sought to establish a recruiting&#8209;and&#8209;cover capability within America&rsquo;s  most prestigious journalistic institutions. By operating under the guise of  accredited news correspondents, Dulles believed, CIA operatives abroad would be  accorded a degree of access and freedom of movement unobtainable under almost  any other type of cover.</p>
<p>American publishers, like so many other  corporate and institutional leaders at the time, were willing to commit the  resources of their companies to the struggle against &ldquo;global Communism.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the traditional line separating the American press corps and  government was often indistinguishable: rarely was a news agency used to  provide cover for CIA operatives abroad without the knowledge and consent of either its principal owner, publisher or senior editor.  Thus, contrary to the notion that the CIA insidiously infiltrated the  journalistic community, there is ample evidence that America&rsquo;s leading  publishers and news executives allowed themselves and their organizations to  become handmaidens to the intelligence services. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not pick on some poor  reporters, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; William Colby exclaimed at one point to the Church  committee&rsquo;s investigators. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the managements. They were  witting.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all, about twenty&#8209;five news organizations including those  listed at the beginning of this article) provided cover for the Agency.</p>
<p>In addition to cover capability, Dulles  initiated a &ldquo;debriefing&rdquo; procedure under which American correspondents  returning from abroad routinely emptied their notebooks and offered their  impressions to Agency personnel. Such arrangements, continued by Dulles&rsquo;  successors, to the present day, were made with literally dozens of news  organizations. In the 1950s, it was not uncommon for returning reporters to be  met at the ship by CIA officers. &ldquo;There would be these guys from the CIA  flashing ID cards and looking like they belonged at the Yale Club,&rdquo; said Hugh  Morrow, a former <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> correspondent who is now press  secretary to former vice&#8209;president Nelson Rockefeller. &ldquo;It got to be so routine that you felt a little miffed if you weren&rsquo;t asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CIA officials almost always refuse to  divulge the names of journalists who have cooperated with the Agency. They say  it would be unfair to judge these individuals in a context different from the  one that spawned the relationships in the first place. &ldquo;There was a time when  it wasn&rsquo;t considered a crime to serve your government,&rdquo; said one high&#8209;level CIA  official who makes no secret of his bitterness. &ldquo;This all has to be considered  in the context of the morality of the times, rather than against latter&#8209;day  standards&mdash;and hypocritical standards at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many journalists who covered World War II were  close to people in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime predecessor of  the CIA; more important, they were all on the same side. When the war ended and  many OSS officials went into the CIA, it was only natural that these  relationships would continue. Meanwhile, the first postwar generation of  journalists entered the profession; they shared the same political and  professional values as their mentors. &ldquo;You had a gang of people who worked  together during World War II and never got over it,&rdquo; said one Agency official.  &ldquo;They were genuinely motivated and highly susceptible to intrigue and being on  the inside. Then in the Fifties and Sixties there was a national consensus  about a national threat. The Vietnam War tore everything to pieces&mdash;shredded the  consensus and threw it in the air.&rdquo; Another Agency official observed: &ldquo;Many  journalists didn&rsquo;t give a second thought to associating with the Agency. But  there was a point when the ethical issues which most people had submerged finally  surfaced. Today, a lot of these guys vehemently deny that they had any  relationship with the Agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outset, the use of journalists was among  the CIA&rsquo;s most sensitive undertakings, with full knowledge restricted to the  Director of Central Intelligence and a few of his chosen deputies. Dulles and  his successors were fearful of what would happen if a journalist&#8209;operative&rsquo;s  cover was blown, or if details of the Agency&rsquo;s dealings with the press  otherwise became public. As a result, contacts with the heads of news&nbsp;  organizations were normally initiated by Dulles and succeeding Directors of  Central Intelligence; by the deputy directors and division chiefs in charge of  covert operations&mdash;Frank Wisner, Cord Meyer Jr., Richard Bissell, Desmond FitzGerald, Tracy Barnes, Thomas Karamessines  and Richard Helms himself a former UPI correspondent); and, occasionally, by  others in the CIA hierarchy known to have an unusually close social  relationship with a particular publisher or broadcast executive.1</p>
<p>James Angleton, who was recently removed as the  Agency&rsquo;s head of counterintelligence operations, ran a completely independent  group of journalist&#8209;operatives who performed sensitive and frequently dangerous  assignments; little is known about this group for the simple reason that  Angleton deliberately kept only the vaguest of files.</p>
<p>The CIA even ran a formal training  program in the 1950s to teach its agents to be journalists. Intelligence  officers were &ldquo;taught to make noises like reporters,&rdquo; explained a high CIA  official, and were then placed in major news  organizations with help from management. &ldquo;These were the guys who went through  the ranks and were told &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to he a journalist,&rsquo;&rdquo; the CIA official  said. Relatively few of the 400&#8209;some relationships described in Agency files  followed that pattern, however; most involved persons who were already bona  fide journalists when they began undertaking tasks for the Agency.</p>
<p>The Agency&rsquo;s relationships with  journalists, as described in CIA files, include the following general  categories:</p>
<p>&#9632; Legitimate, accredited staff members of news  organizations&mdash;usually reporters. Some were paid; some worked for the Agency on  a purely voluntary basis. This group includes many of the best&#8209;known  journalists who carried out tasks for the CIA. The files show that the salaries  paid to reporters by newspaper and broadcast networks were sometimes  supplemented by nominal payments from the CIA, either in the form of retainers,  travel expenses or outlays for specific services performed.&nbsp; Almost all  the payments were made in cash. The accredited category also includes  photographers, administrative personnel of foreign news bureaus and members of  broadcast technical crews.)</p>
<p>Two of the Agency&rsquo;s most valuable  personal relationships in the 1960s, according to CIA officials, were with  reporters who covered Latin America&mdash;Jerry O&rsquo;Leary of the <em>Washington Star</em> and Hal Hendrix of the <em>Miami News</em>, a Pulitzer Prize winner who became a  high official of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Hendrix  was extremely helpful to the Agency in providing information about individuals  in Miami&rsquo;s Cuban exile community. O&rsquo;Leary was considered a valued asset in  Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Agency files contain lengthy reports of both  men&rsquo;s activities on behalf of the CIA.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Leary maintains that his dealings were limited to  the normal give&#8209;and&#8209;take that goes on between reporters abroad and their  sources. CIA officials dispute the contention: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question Jerry  reported for us,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Jerry did assessing and spotting [of prospective  agents] but he was better as a reporter for us.&rdquo; Referring to O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s  denials, the official added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what in the world he&rsquo;s worried about  unless he&rsquo;s wearing that mantle of integrity the Senate put on you  journalists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Leary attributes the difference of  opinion to semantics. &ldquo;I might call them up and say something like, &lsquo;Papa Doc  has the clap, did you know that?&rsquo; and they&rsquo;d put it in the file. I don&rsquo;t  consider that reporting for them.... it&rsquo;s useful to be friendly to them and,  generally, I felt friendly to them. But I think they were more helpful to me  than I was to them.&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary took particular exception to being described in the  same context as Hendrix. &ldquo;Hal was really doing work for them,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Leary.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still with the <em>Star</em>. He ended up at ITT.&rdquo; Hendrix could not be  reached for comment. According to Agency officials, neither Hendrix nor O&rsquo;Leary  was paid by the CIA.</p>
<p>&#9632; Stringers2 and freelancers.  Most were payrolled by the Agency under standard  contractual terms. Their journalistic credentials were often supplied by  cooperating news organizations. some filed news  stories; others reported only for the CIA. On some occasions, news  organizations were not informed by the CIA that their stringers were also  working for the Agency.</p>
<p>&#9632; Employees of so&#8209;called CIA &ldquo;proprietaries.&rdquo; During the past  twenty&#8209;five years, the Agency has secretly bankrolled numerous foreign press  services, periodicals and newspapers&mdash;both English and foreign language&mdash;which  provided excellent cover for CIA operatives. One such publication was the <em>Rome  Daily American, </em>forty percent of which was owned by the CIA until the  1970s. The <em>Daily American </em>went out of business this year,</p>
<p>&#9632; Editors, publishers and broadcast network executives. The CIAs relationship with most news executives differed  fundamentally from those with working reporters and stringers, who were much  more subject to direction from the Agency. A few executives&mdash;Arthur Hays  Sulzberger of the <em>New York Times </em>among them&mdash;signed secrecy agreements.  But such formal understandings were rare: relationships between Agency  officials and media executives were usually social&mdash;&rdquo;The P and Q Street axis in  Georgetown,&rdquo; said one source. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell Wilharn  Paley to sign a piece of paper saying he won&rsquo;t fink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#9632; Columnists and commentators.  There are perhaps a dozen well known columnists and broadcast commentators  whose relationships with the CIA go far beyond those normally maintained  between reporters and their sources. They are referred to at the Agency as  &ldquo;known assets&rdquo; and can be counted on to perform a variety of undercover tasks;  they are considered receptive to the Agency&rsquo;s point of view on various subjects.  Three of the most widely read columnists who maintained such ties with the  Agency are C.L. Sulzberger of the <em>New York Times, </em>Joseph Alsop, and the late Stewart Alsop,  whose column appeared in the <em>New York Herald&#8209;Tribune, </em>the <em>Saturday  Evening </em>Post and <em>Newsweek. </em>CIA files contain reports of specific  tasks all three undertook. Sulzberger is still regarded as an active asset by  the Agency. According to a senior CIA official, &ldquo;Young Cy  Sulzberger had some uses.... He signed a secrecy agreement because we gave him  classified information.... There was sharing, give and take. We&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Wed  like to know this; if we tell you this will it help you get access to so&#8209;and&#8209;so?&rsquo;  Because of his access in Europe he had an Open Sesame. We&rsquo;d ask him to just  report: &lsquo;What did so&#8209;and&#8209;so say, what did he look  like, is he healthy?&rsquo; He was very eager, he loved to cooperate.&rdquo; On one  occasion, according to several CIA officials, Sulzberger was given a briefing  paper by the Agency which ran almost verbatim under the columnist&rsquo;s byline in  the <em>Times. &ldquo;</em>Cycame out and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a piece,  can you give me some background?&rsquo;&rdquo; a CIA officer said. &ldquo;We gave it to Cy as a background piece and Cy gave it to the printers and  put his name on it.&rdquo; Sulzberger denies that any incident occurred. &ldquo;A lot of  baloney,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sulzberger claims that he was never  formally &ldquo;tasked&rdquo; by the Agency and that he &ldquo;would never get caught near the  spook business. My relations were totally informal&mdash;I had a goodmany  friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they consider me an asset. They can ask me  questions. They find out you&rsquo;re going to Slobovia and  they say, &lsquo;Can we talk to you when you get back?&rsquo; ...  Or they&rsquo;ll want to know if the head of the Ruritanian  government is suffering from psoriasis. But I never took an assignment from one  of those guys.... I&rsquo;ve known Wisner well, and Helms and even McCone [former CIA  director John McCone] I used to play golf with. But they&rsquo;d have had to he awfully subtle to have used me.</p>
<p>Sulzberger says he was asked to sign the  secrecy agreement in the 1950s<em>. </em>&ldquo;A guy came around and said, &lsquo;You are a  responsible newsman and we need you to sign this if we are going to show you  anything classified.&rsquo; I said I didn&rsquo;t want to get entangled and told them, &lsquo;Go  to my uncle [Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then publisher of the <em>New York Times</em>]  and if he says to sign it I will.&rsquo;&rdquo; His uncle subsequently signed such an  agreement, Sulzberger said, and he thinks he did too, though he is unsure. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, twenty&#8209;some years is a long time.&rdquo; He  described the whole question as &ldquo;a bubble in a bathtub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart Alsop&rsquo;s  relationship with the Agency was much more extensive than Sulzberger&rsquo;s. One  official who served at the highest levels in the CIA said flatly: &ldquo;Stew Alsop was a CIA agent.&rdquo; An equally senior official refused  to define Alsop&rsquo;s relationship with the Agency except  to say it was a formal one. Other sources said that Alsop  was particularly helpful to the Agency in discussions with, officials of  foreign governments&mdash;asking questions to which the CIA was seeking answers,  planting misinformation advantageous to American policy, assessing  opportunities for CIA recruitment of well&#8209;placed foreigners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolute nonsense,&rdquo; said Joseph Alsop of the notion that his brother was a CIA agent. &ldquo;I  was closer to the Agency than Stew was, though Stew was very close. I dare say  he did perform some tasks&mdash;he just did the correct thing as an American.... The  Founding Fathers [of the CIA] were close personal friends of ours. Dick Bissell  [former CIA deputy director] was my oldest friend, from childhood. It was a  social thing, my dear fellow. I never received a dollar,  I never signed a secrecy agreement. I didn&rsquo;t have to.... I&rsquo;ve done things for  them when I thought they were the right thing to do. I call it doing my duty as  a citizen.</p>
<p>Alsop is willing  to discuss on the record only two of the tasks he undertook: a visit to Laos in  1952 at the behest of Frank Wisner, who felt other American reporters were  using anti&#8209;American sources about uprisings there; and a visit to the Phillipines in 1953 when the CIA thought his presence there  might affect the outcome of an election. &ldquo;Des FitzGerald  urged me to go,&rdquo; Alsop recalled. &ldquo;It would be less  likely that the election could be stolen [by the opponents of Ramon Magsaysay] if the eyes of the world were on them. I stayed  with the ambassador and wrote about what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alsop maintains  that he was never manipulated by the Agency. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get entangled so they  have leverage on you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what I wrote was true. My view was to get  the facts. If someone in the Agency was wrong, I stopped talking to them&mdash;they&rsquo;d  given me phony goods.&rdquo; On one occasion, Alsop said,  Richard Helms authorized the head of the Agency&rsquo;s analytical branch to provide Alsop with information on Soviet military presence along  the Chinese border. &ldquo;The analytical side of the Agency had been dead wrong  about the war in Vietnam&mdash;they thought it couldn&rsquo;t be won,&rdquo; said Alsop. &ldquo;And they were wrong on the Soviet buildup. I  stopped talking to them.&rdquo; Today, he says, &ldquo;People in our business would be  outraged at the kinds of suggestions that were made to me. They shouldn&rsquo;t be.  The CIA did not open itself at all to people it did not trust. Stew and I were  trusted, and I&rsquo;m proud of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MURKY DETAILS OF CIA RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUALS and news  organizations began trickling out in 1973 when it was first disclosed that the  CIA had, on occasion, employed journalists. Those reports, combined with new  information, serve as casebook studies of the Agency&rsquo;s use of journalists for  intelligence purposes. They include:</p>
<p>&#9632; <em>The New York Times</em>. The  Agency&rsquo;s relationship with the <em>Times</em> was by far its most valuable among  newspapers, according to CIA officials. From 1950 to 1966, about ten CIA  employees were provided <em>Times </em>cover under arrangements approved by the  newspaper&rsquo;s late publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. The cover arrangements were  part of a general <em>Times </em>policy&mdash;set by Sulzberger&mdash;to provide assistance  to the CIA whenever possible.</p>
<p>Sulzberger was especially close to Allen Dulles.  &ldquo;At that level of contact it was the mighty talking to the mighty,&rdquo; said a high&#8209;level  CIA official who was present at some of the discussions. &ldquo;There was an agreement  in principle that, yes indeed, we would help each other. The question of cover  came up on several occasions.&nbsp; It was agreed that the actual arrangements  would be handled by subordinates.... The mighty didn&rsquo;t want to know the  specifics; they wanted plausible deniability.</p>
<p>A senior CIA official who reviewed a  portion of the Agency&rsquo;s files on journalists for two hours onSeptember  15th, 1977, said he found documentation of five instances in which the <em>Times</em> had provided cover for CIA employees between 1954 and 1962. In each instance he  said, the arrangements were handled by executives of the <em>Times</em>; the  documents all contained standard Agency language &ldquo;showing that this had been  checked out at higher levels of the <em>New York Times</em>,&rdquo; said the official.  The documents did not mention Sulzberger&rsquo;s name, however&mdash;only those of  subordinates whom the official refused to identify.</p>
<p>The CIA employees who received <em>Times </em>credentials  posed as stringers for the paper abroad and worked as members of clerical  staffs in the <em>Times&rsquo; </em>foreign bureaus. Most were American; two or three  were foreigners.</p>
<p>CIA officials cite two reasons why the  Agency&rsquo;s working relationship with the <em>Times </em>was closer and more  extensive than with any other paper: the fact that the <em>Times </em>maintained  the largest foreign news operation in American daily journalism; and the close  personal ties between the men who ran both institutions.</p>
<p>Sulzberger informed a number of reporters and  editors of his general policy of cooperation with the Agency. &ldquo;We were in touch  with them&mdash;they&rsquo;d talk to us and some cooperated,&rdquo; said a CIA official. The  cooperation usually involved passing on information and &ldquo;spotting&rdquo; prospective  agents among foreigners.</p>
<p>Arthur Hays Sulzberger signed a secrecy  agreement with the CIA in the 1950s, according to CIA officials&mdash;a fact  confirmed by his nephew, C.L. Sulzberger. However, there are varying  interpretations of the purpose of the agreement: C.L. Sulzberger says it  represented nothing more than a pledge not to disclose classified information  made available to the publisher. That contention is supported by some Agency  officials. Others in the Agency maintain that the agreement represented a  pledge never to reveal any of the <em>Times&rsquo; </em>dealings with the CIA,  especially those involving cover. And there are those who note that, because  all cover arrangements are classified, a secrecy agreement would automatically  apply to them.</p>
<p>Attempts to find out which individuals in  the <em>Times </em>organization made the actual arrangements for providing  credentials to CIA personnel have been unsuccessful. In a letter to reporter  Stuart Loory in 1974, Turner Cadedge,  managing editor of the <em>Times </em>from 1951 to 1964, wrote that approaches by  the CIA had been rebuffed by the newspaper. &ldquo;I knew nothing about any  involvement with the CIA... of any of our foreign correspondents on the <em>New  York Times</em>. I heard many times of overtures to our men by the CIA, seeking  to use their privileges, contacts, immunities and, shall we say, superior  intelligence in the sordid business of spying and informing. If any one of them  succumbed to the blandishments or cash offers, I was not aware of it.  Repeatedly, the CIA and other hush&#8209;hush agencies sought to make arrangements  for &lsquo;cooperation&rsquo; even with <em>Times </em>management, especially during or soon  after World War II, but we always resisted. Our motive was to protect our  credibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Wayne Phillips, a former <em>Times</em>reporter, the CIA invoked  Arthur Hays Sulzberger&rsquo;s name when it tried to recruit him as an undercover operative  in 1952 while he was studying at Columbia University&rsquo;s Russian Institute.  Phillips said an Agency official told him that the CIA had &ldquo;a working  arrangement&rdquo; with the publisher in which other reporters abroad had been placed  on the Agency&rsquo;s payroll. Phillips, who remained at the <em>Times </em>until 1961,  later obtained CIA documents under the Freedom of Information Act which show  that the Agency intended to develop him as a clandestine &ldquo;asset&rdquo; for use  abroad.</p>
<p>On January 31st, 1976, the <em>Times </em>carried  a brief story describing the ClAs attempt to recruit  Phillips. It quoted Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the  present publisher, as follows: &ldquo;I never heard of the <em>Times </em>being  approached, either in my capacity as publisher or as the son of the late Mr.  Sulzberger.&rdquo; The <em>Times </em>story, written by John M. Crewdson,  also reported that Arthur Hays Sulzberger told an unnamed former correspondent  that he might he approached by the CIA after arriving at a new post abroad.  Sulzberger told him that he was not &ldquo;under any obligation to agree,&rdquo; the story  said and that the publisher himself would be &ldquo;happier&rdquo; if he refused to  cooperate. &ldquo;But he left it sort of up to me,&rdquo; the <em>Times </em>quoted its  former reporter as saying. &ldquo;The message was if I really wanted to do that,  okay, but he didn&rsquo;t think it appropriate for a <em>Times </em>correspondent&rdquo;</p>
<p>C.L. Sulzberger, in a telephone interview,  said he had no knowledge of any CIA personnel using <em>Times </em>cover or of  reporters for the paper working actively for the Agency. He was the paper&rsquo;s  chief of foreign service from 1944 to 1954 and  expressed doubt that his uncle would have approved such arrangements. More  typical of the late publisher, said&nbsp; Sulzberger, was a promise made to  Allen Dulles&rsquo; brother, John Foster<em>, </em>then secretary of state, that no <em>Times </em>staff member would be permitted to accept an invitation to visit the  People&rsquo;s Republic of China without John Foster Dulles&rsquo; consent. Such an  invitation was extended to the publisher&rsquo;s nephew in the 1950s; Arthur  Sulzberger forbade him to accept it. &ldquo;It was seventeen years before another <em>Times </em>correspondent was invited,&rdquo; C.L. Sulzberger recalled.</p>
<p>&#9632; The Columbia Broadcasting System.  CBS was unquestionably the CIAs most valuable  broadcasting asset. CBS President William Paley and  Allen Dulles enjoyed an easy working and social relationship. Over the years,  the network provided cover for CIA employees, including at least one well&#8209;known  foreign correspondent and several stringers; it supplied outtakes of newsfilm to the CIA3; established a formal  channel of communication between the Washington bureau chief and the Agency;  gave the Agency access to the CBS newsfilm library;  and allowed reports by CBS correspondents to the Washington and New York  newsrooms to be routinely monitored by the CIA. Once a year during the 1950s and  early 1960s, CBS correspondents joined the CIA hierarchy for private dinners  and briefings.</p>
<p>The details of the CBS&#8209;CIA arrangements  were worked out by subordinates of both Dulles and Paley.  &ldquo;The head of the company doesn&rsquo;t want to know the fine points, nor does the  director,&rdquo; said a CIA official. &ldquo;Both designate aides to work that out. It  keeps them above the battle.&rdquo; Dr. Frank Stanton, for 25 years president of the  network, was aware of the general arrangements Paley  made with Dulles&mdash;including those for cover, according to CIA officials.  Stanton, in an interview last year, said he could not recall any cover  arrangements.) But Paley&rsquo;s designated contact for the  Agency was Sig Mickelson, president of CBS News  between 1954 and 1961. On one occasion, Mickelson has said, he complained to  Stanton about having to use a pay telephone to call the CIA, and Stanton  suggested he install a private line, bypassing the CBS switchboard, for the  purpose. According to Mickelson, he did so. Mickelson is now president of Radio  Free Europe and Radio Liberty, both of which were associated with the CIA for  many years.</p>
<p>In 1976, CBS News president Richard Salant ordered an in&#8209;house investigation of the network's  dealings with the CIA. Some of its findings were first disclosed by Robert Scheer in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.) But Salant's report makes no mention of some of his own  dealings with the Agency, which continued into the 1970s.</p>
<p>Many details about the CBS&#8209;CIA  relationship were found in Mickelson's files by two investigators for Salant. Among the documents they found was a September  13th, 1957, memo to Mickelson fromTed Koop,<strong> </strong>CBS  News bureau chief&nbsp; in Washington from 1948 to 1961. It describes a phone  call to Koop from Colonel Stanley Grogan of the CIA: "Grogan phoned to say  that Reeves [J. B. Love Reeves, another CIA official] is going to New York to  be in charge of the CIA contact office there and will call to see you and some  of your confreres. Grogan says normal activities will continue to channel through  the Washington office of CBS News." The report to Salant  also states: "Further investigation of Mickelson's files reveals some  details of the relationship between the CIA and CBS News.... Two key  administrators of this relationship were Mickelson and Koop.... The main  activity appeared to be the delivery of CBS newsfilm  to the CIA.... In addition there is evidence that, during 1964 to 1971, film  material, including some outtakes, were supplied by the CBS Newsfilm  Library to the CIA through and at the direction of Mr. Koop4....  Notes in Mr. Mickelson's files indicate that the CIA used CBS films for  training... All of the above Mickelson activities were handled on a  confidential basis without mentioning the words Central Intelligence Agency.  The films were sent to individuals at post&#8209;office box numbers and were paid for  by individual, nor government, checks. ..." Mickelson also regularly sent  the CIA an internal CBS newsletter, according to the report.</p>
<p>Salant's investigation led  him to conclude that Frank Kearns, a CBS&#8209;TV reporter from 1958 to 1971,  "was a CIA guy who got on the payroll somehow through a CIA contact with  somebody at CBS." Kearns and Austin Goodrich, a CBS stringer, were  undercover CIA employees, hired under arrangements approved by Paley.</p>
<p>Last year a spokesman for Paley denied a report by former CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr that Mickelson and he had discussed Goodrich's CIA  status during a meeting with two Agency representatives in 1954. The spokesman  claimed Paley had no knowledge that Goodrich had  worked for the CIA. "When I moved into the job I was told by Paley that there was an ongoing relationship with the  CIA," Mickelson said in a recent interview. "He introduced me to two  agents who he said would keep in touch. We all discussed the Goodrich situation  and film arrangements. I assumed this was a normal relationship at the time.  This was at the height of the Cold War and I assumed the communications media  were cooperating&mdash;though the Goodrich matter was compromising.</p>
<p>At the headquarters of CBS News in New  York, Paley's cooperation with the CIA is taken for  granted by many news executives and reporters, despite tile denials. Paley, 76, was not interviewed by Salant's  investigators. "It wouldn't do any good," said one CBS executive.  "It is the single subject about which his memory has failed."</p>
<p>Salant  discussed his own contacts with the CIA, and the fact he continued many of his  predecessor's practices, in an interview with this reporter last year. The contacts,  he said, began in February 1961, "when I got a phone call from a CIA man  who said he had a working relationship with Sig  Mickelson. The man said, 'Your bosses know all about it.'"&nbsp; According  to Salant, the CIA representative asked that CBS  continue to supply the Agency with unedited newstapes  and make its correspondents available for debriefingby Agency  officials. Said Salant: "I said no on talking to the reporters, and let them see  broadcast tapes, but no outtakes.&nbsp; This went on for a number of years&mdash;into  the early Seventies."</p>
<p>In 1964 and 1965, Salant  served on a super-secret CIA task force which explored methods of beaming  American propaganda broadcasts to the People's Republic of China. The other  members of the four&#8209;man study team were Zbigniew Brzezinski, then a professor at Columbia University;  William Griffith, then professor of political science at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology., and John Haves, then vice&#8209;president of the Washington  Post Company for radio&#8209;TV5. The principal government officials  associated with the project were Cord Meyer of the CIA; McGeorge  Bundy, then special assistant to the president for national security; Leonard  Marks, then director of the USIA; and Bill Moyers,  then special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson and now a CBS correspondent.</p>
<p>Salant's  involvement in the project began with a call from Leonard Marks, "who told  me the White House wanted to form a committee of four people to make a study of  U.S. overseas broadcasts behind the Iron Curtain." When Salant arrived in Washington for the first meeting he was  told that the project was CIA sponsored. "Its purpose," he said,  "was to determine how best to set up shortwave broadcasts into Red  China." Accompanied by a CIA officer named Paul Henzie,  the committee of four subsequently traveled around the world inspecting  facilities run by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty both CIA&#8209;run operations  at the time), the Voice of America and Armed Forces Radio. After more than a  year of study, they submitted a report to Moyers  recommending that the government establish a broadcast service, run by the  Voice of America, to be beamed at the People's Republic of China. Salant has served two tours as head of CBS News, from 1961&#8209;64  and 1966&#8209;present. At the time of the China project he was a CBS corporate  executive.)</p>
<p>&#9632; <em>Time </em>and <em>Newsweek </em>magazines.  According to CIA and Senate sources, Agency files contain written agreements  with former foreign correspondents and stringers for both the weekly news  magazines.&nbsp; The same sources refused to say whether the CIA has ended all  its associations with individuals who work for the two publications. Allen  Dulles often interceded with his good friend, the late Henry Luce, founder of <em>Time </em>and <em>Life </em>magazines, who readily allowed certain members of his staff  to work for the Agency and agreed to provide jobs and credentials for other CIA  operatives who lacked journalistic experience.</p>
<p>For many years, Luce's personal emissary  to the CIA was C.D. Jackson, a Time Inc., vice&#8209;president who was publisher of <em>Life </em>magazine from 1960 until his death in 1964.While a <em>Time </em>executive,  Jackson coauthored a CIA&#8209;sponsored study recommending the reorganization of the  American intelligence services in the early 1950s. Jackson, whose Time&#8209;Life service  was interrupted by a one&#8209;year White House tour as an  assistant to President Dwight Eisenhower, approved specific arrangements for  providing CIA employees with Time&#8209;Life cover. Some of these arrangements were  made with the knowledge of Luce's wife, Clare Boothe.  Other arrangements for <em>Time </em>cover, according to CIA officials including  those who dealt with Luce), were made with the knowledge of Hedley Donovan, now  editor&#8209;in&#8209;chief of Time Inc. Donovan, who took over editorial direction of all  Time Inc. publications in 1959, denied in a telephone interview that he knew of  any such arrangements. "I was never approached and I'd be amazed if Luce  approved such arrangements," Donovan said. "Luce had a very  scrupulous regard for the difference between journalism and government."</p>
<p>In the 1950s and early 1960s<em>, Time </em>magazine's  foreign correspondents attended CIA "briefing" dinners similar to  those the CIA held for CBS. And Luce, according to CIA officials, made it a  regular practice to brief Dulles or other high Agency officials when he  returned from his frequent trips abroad. Luce and the men who ran his magazines  in the 1950s and 1960s encouraged their foreign correspondents to provide help  to the CIA, particularly information that might be useful to the Agency for  intelligence purposes or recruiting foreigners.</p>
<p>At <em>Newsweek</em>, Agency sources  reported, the CIA engaged the services of' several foreign correspondents and  stringers under arrangements approved by senior editors at the magazine. <em>Newsweek's</em> stringer in Rome in the mid&#8209;Fifties made little secret of the fact that he  worked for the CIA. Malcolm Muir, <em>Newsweek's </em>editor from its founding in  1937 until its sale to the Washington Post Company in 1961, said in a recent  interview that his dealings with the CIA were limited to private briefings he  gave Allen Dulles after trips abroad and arrangements he approved for regular  debriefing of <em>Newsweek </em>correspondents by the Agency. He said that he had  never provided cover for CIA operatives, but that others high in the <em>Newsweek </em>organization might have done so without his knowledge.</p>
<p>"I would have thought there might  have been stringers who were agents, but I didn't know who they were,"  said Muir. "I do think in those days the CIA kept pretty close touch with  all responsible reporters. Whenever I heard something that I thought might be  of interest to Allen Dulles, I'd call him up.... At one point he appointed one  of his CIA men to keep in regular contact with our reporters, a chap that I  knew but whose name I can't remember. I had a number of friends in Alien  Dulles' organization." Muir said that Harry Kern, <em>Newsweek's </em>foreign  editor from 1945 until 1956, and Ernest K. Lindley, the magazine's Washington  bureau chief during the same period "regularly checked in with various fellows  in the CIA."</p>
<p>"To the best of my knowledge."  said Kern, "nobody at Newsweek worked for the CIA... The informal  relationship was there. Why have anybody sign  anything? What we knew we told them [the CIA] and the State Department.... When  I went to Washington, I would talk to Foster or Allen Dulles about what was  going on. ... We thought it was admirable at the time. We were all on the same  side." CIA officials say that Kern's dealings with the Agency were  extensive. In 1956, he left <em>Newsweek </em>to run <em>Foreign Reports<strong>, </strong></em>a  Washington&#8209;based newsletter whose subscribers Kern refuses to identify.</p>
<p>Ernest Lindley, who remained at <em>Newsweek </em>until 1961, said in a recent interview that he regularly consulted with  Dulles and other high CIA officials before going abroad and briefed them upon  his return. "Allen was very helpful to me and I tried to reciprocate when  I could," he said. "I'd give him my impressions of people I'd met  overseas. Once or twice he asked me to brief a large group of intelligence  people; when I came back from the Asian&#8209;African conference in 1955, for  example; they mainly wanted to know about various people."</p>
<p>As Washington bureau chief, Lindley said  he learned from Malcolm Muir that the magazine's stringer in southeastern  Europe was a CIA contract employee&mdash;given credentials under arrangements worked  out with the management. "I remember it came up&mdash;whether it was a good idea  to keep this person from the Agency; eventually it was decided to discontinue  the association," Lindley said.</p>
<p>When <em>Newsweek </em>was<strong></strong>purchased  by the Washington Post Company, publisher Philip L. Graham was informed by  Agency officials that the CIA occasionally used the magazine for cover  purposes, according to CIA sources. "It was widely known that Phil Graham  was somebody you could get help from," said a former deputy director of  the Agency. "Frank Wisner dealt with him." Wisner, deputy director of  the CIA from 1950 until shortly before his suicide in 1965, was the Agency's  premier orchestrator of "black" operations,  including many in which journalists were involved. Wisner liked to boast of his  "mighty Wurlitzer," a wondrous propaganda instrument he built, and  played, with help from the press.) Phil Graham was probably Wisner's closest  friend. But Graharn, who committed suicide in 1963,  apparently knew little of the specifics of any cover arrangements with <em>Newsweek</em>,  CIA sources said.</p>
<p>In 1965&#8209;66, an accredited <em>Newsweek<strong> </strong></em>stringer  in the Far East was in fact a CIA contract employee earning an annual salary of  $10,000 from the Agency, according to Robert T. Wood, then a CIA officer in the  Hong Kong station. Some, <em>Newsweek </em>correspondents and stringers continued  to maintain covert ties with the Agency into the 1970s, CIA sources said.</p>
<p>Information about Agency dealings with  the <em>Washington Post</em> newspaper is extremely sketchy. According to CIA  officials, some <em>Post </em>stringers have been CIA employees, but these  officials say they do not know if anyone in the Post management was aware of  the arrangements.</p>
<p>All editors&#8209;in&#8209;chief and managing editors  of the <em>Post </em>since 1950 say they knew of no formal Agency relationship  with either stringers or members of the <em>Post </em>staff. &ldquo;If anything was  done it was done by Phil without our knowledge,&rdquo; said one. Agency officials,  meanwhile, make no claim that <em>Post </em>staff members have had covert  affiliations with the Agency while working for the paper.6</p>
<p>Katharine Graham, Philip Graham&rsquo;s widow  and the current publisher of the <em>Post</em>, says she has never been informed  of any CIA relationships with either <em>Post </em>or <em>Newsweek </em>personnel.  In November of 1973, Mrs. Graham called William Colby and asked if any Post  stringers or staff members were associated with the CIA. Colby assured her that  no staff members were employed by the Agency but refused to discuss the  question of stringers.</p>
<p>&#9632; The <em>Louisville Courier&#8209;Journal.</em> From December 1964 until March 1965, a CIA undercover operative named  Robert H. Campbell worked on the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal. </em>According to high&#8209;level  CIA sources, Campbell was hired by the paper under arrangements the Agency made  with Norman E. Isaacs, then executive editor of the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em>.  Barry Bingham Sr., then publisher of the paper, also had knowledge of the  arrangements, the sources said. Both Isaacs and Bingham have denied knowing  that Campbell was an intelligence agent when he was hired.</p>
<p>The complex saga of Campbell&rsquo;s hiring was  first revealed in a <em>Courier&#8209;Journal </em>story written by James R Herzog on  March 27th, 1976, during the Senate committee&rsquo;s investigation, Herzog&rsquo;s account  began: &ldquo;When 28&#8209;year&#8209;old Robert H. Campbell was hired as a <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em> reporter in December 1964, he couldn&rsquo;t type and knew little about news  writing.&rdquo; The account then quoted the paper&rsquo;s former managing editor as saying  that Isaacs told him that Campbell was hired as a result of a CIA request:  &ldquo;Norman said, when he was in Washington [in 1964], he had been called to lunch  with some friend of his who was with the CIA [and that] he wanted to send this  young fellow down to get him a little knowledge of newspapering.&rdquo;  All aspects of Campbell&rsquo;s hiring were highly unusual. No effort had been made  to check his credentials, and his employment records contained the following  two notations: &ldquo;Isaacs has files of correspondence and investigation of this  man&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;Hired for temporary work&mdash;no reference checks completed or needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The level of Campbell&rsquo;s journalistic  abilities apparently remained consistent during his stint at the paper, &ldquo;The  stuff that Campbell turned in was almost unreadable,&rdquo; said a former assistant  city editor. One of Campbell&rsquo;s major reportorial projects was a feature about  wooden Indians. It was never published. During his tenure at the paper,  Campbell frequented a bar a few steps from the office where, on occasion, he  reportedly confided to fellow drinkers that he was a CIA employee.</p>
<p>According to CIA sources, Campbell&rsquo;s tour  at the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal </em>was arranged to provide him with a record of  journalistic experience that would enhance the plausibility of future  reportorial cover and teach him something about the newspaper business. The <em>Courier&#8209;Journal&rsquo;s </em>investigation also turned up the fact that before coming to Louisville he  had worked briefly for the Hornell, New York, <em>Evening Tribune, </em>published  by Freedom News, Inc. CIA sources said the Agency had made arrangements with  that paper&rsquo;s management to employ Campbell.7</p>
<p>At the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em>, Campbell  was hired under arrangements made with Isaacs and approved by Bingham, said CIA  and Senate sources. &ldquo;We paid the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em> so they could pay his  salary,&rdquo; said an Agency official who was involved in the transaction.  Responding by letter to these assertions, Isaacs, who left Louisville to become  president and publisher of the Wilmington Delaware) <em>News &amp; Journal</em>,  said: &ldquo;All I can do is repeat the simple truth&mdash;that never, under any  circumstances, or at any time, have I ever knowingly hired a government agent.  I&rsquo;ve also tried to dredge my memory, but Campbell&rsquo;s hiring meant so little to me  that nothing emerges.... None of this is to say that I couldn&rsquo;t have been &lsquo;had.&rsquo;&rdquo;.Barry Bingham Sr., said last year in a telephone  interview that he had no specific memory of Campbell&rsquo;s hiring and denied that he  knew of any arrangements between the newspaper&rsquo;s management and the CIA.  However, CIA officials said that the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em>, through contacts  with Bingham, provided other unspecified assistance to the Agency in the 1950s  and 1960s. The Courier&#8209;Journal&rsquo;s detailed, front&#8209;page account of Campbell&rsquo;s  hiring was initiated by Barry Bingham Jr., who succeeded his father as editor  and publisher of the paper in 1971. The article is the only major piece of self&#8209;investigation  by a newspaper that has appeared on this subject.8</p>
<p>&#9632; The American Broadcasting Company and  the National Broadcasting Company. According to CIA officials, ABC  continued to provide cover for some CIA operatives through the 1960s. One was  Sam Jaffe who CIA officials said performed clandestine tasks for the Agency.  Jaffe has acknowledged only providing the CIA with information. In addition,  another well&#8209;known network correspondent performed covert tasks for the Agency,  said CIA sources. At the time of the Senate bearings, Agency officials serving  at the highest levels refused to say whether the CIA was still maintaining  active relationships with members of the ABC&#8209;News organization. All cover  arrangements were made with the knowledge off ABC executives, the sources said.</p>
<p>These same sources professed to know few  specifies about the Agency&rsquo;s relationships with NBC, except that several  foreign correspondents of the network undertook some assignments for the Agency  in the 1950s and 1960s. &ldquo;It was a thing people did then,&rdquo; said Richard Wald, president of NBC News since 1973. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be  surprised if people here&mdash;including some of the correspondents in those days&mdash;had  connections with the Agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#9632; The Copley Press, and its subsidiary,  the Copley News Service. This relationship, first disclosed publicly by  reporters Joe Trento and Dave Roman in <em>Penthouse</em> magazine, is said by CIA officials to have been among the Agency&rsquo;s most  productive in terms of getting &ldquo;outside&rdquo; cover for its employees. Copley owns  nine newspapers in California and Illinois&mdash;among them the <em>San Diego Union </em>and <em>Evening Tribune. </em>The Trento&#8209;Roman account,  which was financed by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism,  asserted that at least twenty&#8209;three Copley News Service employees performed  work for the CIA. &ldquo;The Agency&rsquo;s involvement with the Copley organization is so  extensive that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to sort out,&rdquo; said a CIA official who was  asked about the relationship late in 1976. Other Agency officials said then  that James S. Copley, the chain&rsquo;s owner until his death in 1973, personally  made most of the cover arrangements with the CIA.</p>
<p>According to Trento and  Roman, Copley personally volunteered his news service to then&#8209;president  Eisenhower to act as &ldquo;the eyes and ears&rdquo; against &ldquo;the Communist threat in Latin  and Central America&rdquo; for &ldquo;our intelligence services.&rdquo;&nbsp; James Copley was  also the guiding hand behind the Inter&#8209;American Press Association, a CIA&#8209;funded  organization with heavy membership among right&#8209;wing Latin American newspaper  editors.</p>
<p>&#9632; Other major news organizations.  According to Agency officials, CIA files document additional cover arrangements  with the following news&#8209;gathering organizations, among others: the <em>New York  Herald&#8209;Tribune</em>, the <em>Saturday&#8209;Evening Post</em>, Scripps&#8209;Howard  Newspapers, Hearst Newspapers Seymour K. Freidin,  Hearst&rsquo;s current London bureau chief and a former <em>&nbsp;Herald&#8209;Tribune </em>editor  and correspondent, has been identified as a CIA operative by Agency sources),  Associated Press,9 United Press International, the Mutual  Broadcasting System, Reuters and the <em>Miami Herald</em>. Cover arrangements  with the <em>Herald</em>, according to CIA officials, were unusual in that they  were made &ldquo;on the ground by the CIA station in Miami, not from CIA  headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just a small part of the  list,&rdquo; in the words of one official who served in the CIA hierarchy. Like many  sources, this official said that the only way to end the uncertainties about  aid furnished the Agency by journalists is to disclose the contents of the CIA  files&mdash;a course opposed by almost all of the thirty&#8209;five present and former CIA  officials interviewed over the course of a year.</p>
<strong>COLBY CUTS HIS LOSSES</strong>
<p>THE CIA&rsquo;S USE OF JOURNALISTS CONTINUED VIRTUALLY unabated until 1973  when, in response to public disclosure that the Agency had secretly employed  American reporters, William Colby began scaling down the program. In his public  statements, Colby conveyed the impression that the use of journalists had been  minimal and of limited importance to the Agency.</p>
<p>He then initiated a series of moves  intended to convince the press, Congress and the public that the CIA had gotten  out of the news business. But according to Agency officials, Colby had in fact  thrown a protective net around his valuable intelligence in the journalistic  community. He ordered his deputies to maintain Agency ties with its best  journalist contacts while severing formal relationships with many regarded as  inactive, relatively unproductive or only marginally important. In reviewing  Agency files to comply with Colby&rsquo;s directive, officials found that many  journalists had not performed useful functions for the CIA in years. Such  relationships, perhaps as many as a hundred, were terminated between 1973 and  1976.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, important CIA operatives who  had been placed on the staffs of some major newspaper and broadcast outlets  were told to resign and become stringers or freelancers, thus enabling Colby to  assure concerned editors that members of their staffs were not CIA employees.  Colby also feared that some valuable stringer&#8209;operatives might find their  covers blown if scrutiny of the Agency&rsquo;s ties with journalists continued. Some  of these individuals were reassigned to jobs on so&#8209;called proprietary  publications&mdash;foreign periodicals and broadcast outlets secretly funded and  staffed by the CIA. Other journalists who had signed formal contracts with the  CIA&mdash;making them employees of the Agency&mdash;were released from their contracts, and  asked to continue working under less formal arrangements.</p>
<p>In November 1973, after many such shifts  had been made, Colby told reporters and editors from the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Star</em> that the Agency had &ldquo;some three dozen&rdquo; American  newsmen &ldquo;on the CIA payroll,&rdquo; including five who worked for &ldquo;general&#8209;circulation  news organizations.&rdquo; Yet even while the Senate Intelligence Committee was  holding its hearings in 1976, according to high&#8209;level CIA sources, the CIA  continued to maintain ties with seventy&#8209;five to ninety journalists of every  description&mdash;executives, reporters, stringers, photographers, columnists, bureau  clerks and members of broadcast technical crews. More than half of these had  been moved off CIA contracts and payrolls but they were still bound by other  secret agreements with the Agency. According to an unpublished report by the  House Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Representative Otis Pike, at  least fifteen news organizations were still providing cover for CIA operatives  as of 1976.</p>
<p>Colby, who built a reputation as one of  the most skilled undercover tacticians in the CIA&rsquo;s history, had himself run  journalists in clandestine operations before becoming director in 1973. But  even he was said by his closest associates to have been disturbed at how  extensively and, in his view, indiscriminately, the Agency continued to use  journalists at the time he took over. &ldquo;Too prominent,&rdquo; the director frequently  said of some of the individuals and news organizations then working with the  CIA. Others in the Agency refer to their best&#8209;known journalistic assets as  &ldquo;brand names.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colby&rsquo;s concern was that he might lose the resource  altogether unless we became a little more careful about who we used and how we  got them,&rdquo; explained one of the former director&rsquo;s deputies. The thrust of  Colby&rsquo;s subsequent actions was to move the Agency&rsquo;s affiliations away from the  so&#8209;called &ldquo;majors&rdquo; and to concentrate them instead in smaller newspaper chains,  broadcasting groups and such specialized publications as trade journals and  newsletters.</p>
<p>After Colby left the Agency on January  28th, 1976, and was succeeded by George Bush, the CIA announced a new policy:  &ldquo;Effective immediately, the CIA will not enter into any paid or contractual  relationship with any full&#8209;time or part&#8209;time news correspondent accredited by any  U.S. news service, newspaper, periodical, radio or television network or  station&rdquo; At the time of the announcement, the Agency acknowledged that the  policy would result in termination of less than half of the relationships with  the 50 U.S. journalists it said were still affiliated with the Agency. The text  of the announcement noted that the CIA would continue to &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; the  voluntary, unpaid cooperation of journalists. Thus, many relationships were  permitted to remain intact.</p>
<p>The Agency&rsquo;s unwillingness to end its use  of journalists and its continued relationships with some news executives is  largely the product of two basic facts of the intelligence game: journalistic  cover is ideal because of the inquisitive nature of a reporter&rsquo;s job; and many  other sources of institutional cover have been denied the CIA in recent years  by businesses, foundations and educational institutions that once cooperated  with the Agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to run a secret agency in this  country,&rdquo; explained one high&#8209;level CIA official. &ldquo;We have a curious ambivalence  about intelligence. In order to serve overseas we need cover. But we have been  fighting a rear&#8209;guard action to try and provide cover. The Peace Corps is off&#8209;limits,  so is USIA, the foundations and voluntary organizations have been off&#8209;limits  since &lsquo;67, and there is a self&#8209;imposed prohibition on Fulbrights  [Fulbright Scholars]. If you take the American community and line up who could  work for the CIA and who couldn&rsquo;t there is a very narrow potential. Even the  Foreign Service doesn&rsquo;t want us. So where the hell do  you go? Business is nice, but the press is a natural. One journalist is worth  twenty agents. He has access, the ability to ask questions without arousing  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>ROLE OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE</strong></p>
<p>DESPITE THE EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD CIA USE OF journalists,  the Senate Intelligence Committee and its staff decided against questioning any  of the reporters, editors, publishers or broadcast executives whose  relationships with the Agency are detailed in CIA files.</p>
<p>According to sources in the Senate and  the Agency, the use of journalists was one of two areas of inquiry which the  CIA went to extraordinary lengths to curtail. The other was the Agency&rsquo;s  continuing and extensive use of academics for recruitment and information  gathering purposes.</p>
<p>In both instances, the sources said,  former directors Colby and Bush and CIA special counsel Mitchell Rogovin were able to convince key members of the committee  that full inquiry or even limited public disclosure of the dimensions of the  activities would do irreparable damage to the nation&rsquo;s intelligence&#8209;gathering  apparatus, as well as to the reputations of hundreds of individuals. Colby was  reported to have been especially persuasive in arguing that disclosure would  bring on a latter&#8209;day &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; in which the victims would be reporters,  publishers and editors.</p>
<p>Walter Elder, deputy to former CIA  director McCone and the principal Agency liaison to the Church committee,  argued that the committee lacked jurisdiction because there had been no misuse  of journalists by the CIA; the relationships had been voluntary. Elder cited as  an example the case of the <em>Louisville Courier&#8209;Journal</em>. &ldquo;Church and other  people on the committee were on the chandelier about the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em>,&rdquo;  one Agency official said, &ldquo;until we pointed out that we had gone to the editor  to arrange cover, and that the editor had said, &lsquo;Fine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some members of the Church committee and  staff feared that Agency officials had gained control of the inquiry and that  they were being hoodwinked. &ldquo;The Agency was extremely clever about it and the  committee played right into its hands,&rdquo; said one congressional source familiar  with all aspects of the inquiry. &ldquo;Church and some of the other members were  much more interested in making headlines than in doing serious, tough  investigating. The Agency pretended to be giving up a lot whenever it was asked  about the flashy stuff&mdash;assassinations and secret weapons and James Bond  operations. Then, when it came to things that they didn&rsquo;t want to give away,  that were much more important to the Agency, Colby in particular called in his  chits. And the committee bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senate committee&rsquo;s investigation into  the use of journalists was supervised by William B. Bader, a former CIA intelligence  officer who returned briefly to the Agency this year as deputy to CIA director Stansfield Turner and is now a high&#8209;level intelligence  official at the Defense Department. Bader was assisted by David Aaron, who now  serves as the deputy to Zbigniew Brzezinski,  President Carter&rsquo;s national security adviser.</p>
<p>According to colleagues on the staff of  the Senate inquiry, both Bader and Aaron were disturbed by the information  contained in CIA files about journalists; they urged that further investigation  he undertaken by the Senate&rsquo;s new permanent CIA oversight committee. That  committee, however, has spent its first year of existence writing a new charter  for the CIA, and members say there has been little interest in delving further  into the CIA&rsquo;s use of the press.</p>
<p>Bader&rsquo;s investigation was conducted under unusually  difficult conditions. His first request for specific information on the use of  journalists was turned down by the CIA on grounds that there had been no abuse  of authority and that current intelligence operations might he compromised.  Senators Walter Huddleston, Howard Baker, Gary Hart, Walter Mondale and Charles  Mathias&mdash;who had expressed interest in the subject of the press and the  CIA&mdash;shared Bader&rsquo;s distress at the CIA&rsquo;s reaction. In a series of phone calls  and meetings with CIA director George Bush and other Agency officials, the  senators insisted that the committee staff be provided information about the  scope of CIA&#8209;press activities. Finally, Bush agreed to order a search of the  files and have those records pulled which deals with operations where  journalists had been used. But the raw files could not he made available to  Bader or the committee, Bush insisted. Instead, the director decided, his  deputies would condense the material into one&#8209;paragraph sum&shy;maries describing  in the most general terms the activities of each individual journalist. Most  important, Bush decreed, the names of journalists and of the news organizations  with which they were affiliated would be omitted from the summaries. However,  there might be some indication of the region where the journalist had served  and a general description of the type of news organization for which he worked.</p>
<p>Assembling the summaries was difficult,  according to CIA officials who supervised the job. There were no &ldquo;journalist  files&rdquo; per se and information had to be collected from divergent sources that  reflect the highly compartmentalized character of the CIA. Case officers who  had handled journalists supplied some names. Files were pulled on various undercover  operations in which it seemed logical that journalists had been used.  Significantly, all work by reporters for the Agency under the category of  covert operations, not foreign intelligence.) Old station records were culled.  &ldquo;We really had to scramble,&rdquo; said one official.</p>
<p>After several weeks, Bader began  receiving the summaries, which numbered over 400 by the time the Agency said it  had completed searching its files.</p>
<p>The Agency played an intriguing numbers game with  the committee. Those who prepared the material say it was physically impossible  to produce all of the Agency&rsquo;s files on the use of journalists. &ldquo;We gave them a  broad, representative picture,&rdquo; said one agency official. &ldquo;We never pretended  it was a total description of the range of activities over 25 years, or of the  number of journalists who have done things for us.&rdquo; A relatively small number  of the summaries described the activities of foreign journalists&mdash;including  those working as stringers for American publications. Those officials most  knowledgeable about the subject say that a figure of 400 American journalists  is on the low side of the actual number who maintained covert relationships and  undertook clandestine tasks.</p>
<p>Bader and others to whom he described the  contents of the summaries immediately reached some general conclusions: the  sheer number of covert relationships with journalists was far greater than the  CIA had ever hinted; and the Agency&rsquo;s use of reporters and news executives was  an intelligence asset of the first magnitude. Reporters had been involved in  almost every conceivable kind of operation. Of the 400&#8209;plus individuals whose  activities were summarized, between 200 and 250 were &ldquo;working journalists&rdquo; in  the usual sense of the term&mdash;reporters, editors, correspondents, photographers;  the rest were employed at least nominally) by book publishers, trade  publications and newsletters.</p>
<p>Still, the summaries were just that:  compressed, vague, sketchy, incomplete. They could be  subject to ambiguous interpretation. And they contained no suggestion that the  CIA had abused its authority by manipulating the editorial content of American  newspapers or broadcast reports.</p>
<p>Bader&rsquo;s unease with what he had found led him to  seek advice from several experienced hands in the fields of foreign relations  and intelligence. They suggested that he press for more information and give  those members of the committee in whom he had the most confidence a general  idea of what the summaries revealed. Bader again went to Senators Huddleston,  Baker, Hart, Mondale and Mathias. Meanwhile, he told the CIA that he wanted to  see more&mdash;the full files on perhaps a hundred or so of the individuals whose  activities had been summarized. The request was turned down outright. The  Agency would provide no more information on the subject. Period.</p>
<p>The CIA&rsquo;s intransigence led to an extraordinary  dinner meeting at Agency headquarters in late March 1976. Those present  included Senators Frank Church who had now been briefed by Bader), and John  Tower, the vice&#8209;chairman of the committee; Bader; William Miller, director of  the committee staff; CIA director Bush; Agency counsel Rogovin;  and Seymour Bolten, a high&#8209;level CIA operative who  for years had been a station chief in Germany and Willy Brandt&rsquo;s case officer. Bolten had been deputized by Bush to deal with the  committee&rsquo;s requests for information on journalists and academics. At the  dinner, the Agency held to its refusal to provide any full files. Nor would it  give the committee the names of any individual journalists described in the 400  summaries or of the news organizations with whom they were affiliated. The  discussion, according to participants, grew heated. The committee&rsquo;s  representatives said they could not honor their mandate&mdash;to determine if the CIA  had abused its authority&mdash;without further information. The CIA maintained it  could not protect its legitimate intelligence operations or its employees if  further disclosures were made to the committee. Many of the journalists were  contract employees of the Agency, Bush said at one point, and the CIA was no  less obligated to them than to any other agents.</p>
<p>Finally, a highly unusual agreement was  hammered out: Bader and Miller would be permitted to examine &ldquo;sanitized&rdquo;  versions of the full files of twenty&#8209;five journalists selected from the  summaries; but the names of the journalists and the news organizations which  employed them would be blanked out, as would the identities of other CIA  employees mentioned in the files. Church and Tower would be permitted to  examine the <em>unsanitized</em>versions of  five of the twenty&#8209;five files&mdash;to attest that the CIA was not hiding anything  except the names. The whole deal was contingent on an agreement that neither Bader, Miner, Tower nor Church would reveal the contents  of the files to other members of the committee or staff.</p>
<p>Bader began reviewing the 400&#8209;some  summaries again. His object was to select twenty&#8209;five that, on the basis of the  sketchy information they contained, seemed to represent a cross section. Dates  of CIA activity, general descriptions of news organizations, types of  journalists and undercover operations all figured in his calculations.</p>
<p>From the twenty&#8209;five files he got back, according  to Senate sources and CIA officials, an unavoidable conclusion emerged: that to  a degree never widely suspected, the CIA in the 1950s, &lsquo;60s and even early &lsquo;70s  had concentrated its relationships with journalists in the most prominent  sectors of the American press corps, including four or five of the largest newspapers  in the country, the broadcast networks and the two major newsweekly magazines.  Despite the omission of names and affiliations from the twenty&#8209;five detailed  files each was between three and eleven inches thick), the information was  usually sufficient to tentatively identify either the  newsman, his affiliation or both&mdash;particularly because so many of them were  prominent in the profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is quite an incredible spread of  relationships,&rdquo; Bader reported to the senators. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to manipulate <em>Time </em>magazine, for example, because there are Agency people at the management  level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ironically, one major news organization  that set limits on its dealings with the CIA, according to Agency officials,  was the one with perhaps the greatest editorial affinity for the Agency&rsquo;s long&#8209;range  goals and policies: <em>U.S. News and World Report. </em>The late David Lawrence,  the columnist and founding editor of <em>U.S. News, </em>was a close friend of  Allen Dulles. But he repeatedly refused requests by the CIA director to use the  magazine for cover purposes, the sources said. At one point, according to a  high CIA official, Lawrence issued orders to his sub&#8209;editors in which he  threatened to fire any <em>U.S. News </em>employee who was found to have entered  into a formal relationship with the Agency. Former editorial executives at the  magazine confirmed that such orders had been issued. CIA sources declined to  say, however, if the magazine remained off&#8209;limits to the Agency after Lawrence&rsquo;s  death in 1973 or if Lawrence&rsquo;s orders had been followed.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bader attempted to get more information  from the CIA, particularly about the Agency&rsquo;s current relationships with  journalists. He encountered a stone wall. &ldquo;Bush has done nothing to date,&rdquo;  Bader told associates. &ldquo;None of the important operations are affected in even a  marginal way.&rdquo; The CIA also refused the staffs requests for more information on  the use of academics. Bush began to urge members of the committee to curtail  its inquiries in both areas and conceal its findings in the final report. &ldquo;He  kept saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fuck these guys in the press and on the campuses,&rsquo; pleading  that they were the only areas of public life with any credibility left,&rdquo;  reported a Senate source. Colby, Elder and Rogovin  also implored individual members of the committee to keep secret what the staff  had found. &ldquo;There were a lot of representations that if this stuff got out some  of the biggest names in journalism would get smeared,&rdquo; said another source. Exposure  of the CIA&rsquo;s relationships with journalists and academics, the Agency feared,  would close down two of the few avenues of agent recruitment still open. &ldquo;The  danger of exposure is not the other side,&rdquo; explained one CIA expert in covert  operations. &ldquo;This is not stuff the other side doesn&rsquo;t know about. The concern  of the Agency is that another area of cover will be denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A senator who was the object of the  Agency&rsquo;s lobbying later said: &ldquo;From the CIA point of view this was the highest,  most sensitive covert program of all.... It was a much larger part of the  operational system than has been indicated.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;I had a great  compulsion to press the point but it was late .... If we had demanded, they  would have gone the legal route to fight it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, time was running out for the  committee. In the view of many staff members, it had squandered its resources  in the search for CIA assassination plots and poison pen letters. It had  undertaken the inquiry into journalists almost as an afterthought. The  dimensions of the program and the CIA&rsquo;s sensitivity to providing information on  it had caught the staff and the committee by surprise. The CIA oversight  committee that would succeed the Church panel would have the inclination and  the time to inquire into the subject methodically; if, as seemed likely, the  CIA refused to cooperate further, the mandate of the successor committee would  put it in a more advantageous position to wage a protracted fight  .... Or so the reasoning went as Church and the few other senators even  vaguely familiar with Bader&rsquo;s findings reached a decision not to pursue the  matter further. No journalists would be interviewed about their dealings with  the Agency&mdash;either by the staff or by the senators, in secret or in open  session. The specter, first raised by CIA officials, of a witch hunt in the  press corps haunted some members of the staff and the committee. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t  about to bring up guys to the committee and then have everybody say they&rsquo;ve  been traitors to the ideals of their profession,&rdquo; said a senator.</p>
<p>Bader, according to associates, was  satisfied with the decision and believed that the successor committee would  pick up the inquiry where he had left it. He was opposed to making public the  names of individual journalists. He had been concerned all along that he had  entered a &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; in which there were no moral absolutes. Had the CIA  &ldquo;manipulated&rdquo; the press in the classic sense of the term? Probably not, he  concluded; the major news organizations and their executives had willingly lent  their resources to the Agency; foreign correspondents had regarded work for the  CIA as a national service and a way of getting better stories and climbing to  the top of their profession. Had the CIA abused its authority? It had dealt  with the press almost exactly as it had dealt with other institutions from  which it sought cover &mdash; the diplomatic service, academia, corporations. There  was nothing in the CIA&rsquo;s charter which declared any of these institutions off&#8209;limits  to America&rsquo;s intelligence service. And, in the case of the press, the Agency  had exercised more care in its dealings than with many other institutions; it  had gone to considerable lengths to restrict its role to information&#8209;gathering  and cover.10</p>
<p>Bader was also said to be concerned that his  knowledge was so heavily based on information furnished by the CIA; he hadn&rsquo;t  gotten the other side of the story from those journalists who had associated  with the Agency. He could be seeing only &ldquo;the lantern show,&rdquo; he told  associates. Still, Bader was reasonably sure that he had seen pretty much the  full panoply of what was in the files. If the CIA had wanted to deceive him it  would have never given away so much, he reasoned. &ldquo;It was smart of the Agency  to cooperate to the extent of showing the material to Bader,&rdquo; observed a  committee source. &ldquo;That way, if one fine day a file popped up, the Agency would  be covered. They could say they had already informed the Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dependence on CIA files posed another  problem. The CIA&rsquo;s perception of a relationship with a journalist might be  quite different than that of the journalist: a CIA official might think he had  exercised control over a journalist; the journalist might think he had simply  had a few drinks with a spook. It was possible that CIA case officers had  written self&#8209;serving memos for the files about their dealings with journalists,  that the CIA was just as subject to common bureaucratic &ldquo;cover&#8209;your&#8209;ass&rdquo;  paperwork as any other agency of government.</p>
<p>A CIA official who attempted to persuade members of  the Senate committee that the Agency&rsquo;s use of journalists had been innocuous  maintained that the files were indeed filled with &ldquo;puffing&rdquo; by case officers.  &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t establish what is puff and what isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he claimed.  Many reporters, he added, &ldquo;were recruited for finite [specific] undertakings  and would be appalled to find that they were listed [in Agency files] as CIA  operatives.&rdquo; This same official estimated that the files contained descriptions  of about half a dozen reporters and correspondents who would be considered  &ldquo;famous&rdquo;&mdash;that is, their names would be recognized by most Americans. &ldquo;The files  show that the CIA goes to the press for and just as often that the press comes  to the CIA,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;...There is a tacit agreement in many of these cases  that there is going to be a quid pro quo&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., that the reporter is going to  get good stories from the Agency and that the CIA will pick up some valuable  services from the reporter.</p>
<p>Whatever the  interpretation, the findings of the Senate committees inquiry into the use of  journalists were deliberately buried&mdash;from the full membership of the committee,  from the Senate and from the public. &ldquo;There was a difference of opinion  on how to treat the subject,&rdquo; explained one source. &ldquo;Some [senators] thought  these were abuses which should be exorcized and there were those who said, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this is bad or not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bader&rsquo;s findings on the subject were never  discussed with the full committee, even in executive session. That might have  led to leaks&mdash;especially in view of the explosive nature of the facts. Since the  beginning of the Church committee&rsquo;s investigation, leaks had been the panel&rsquo;s  biggest collective fear, a real threat to its mission. At the slightest sign of  a leak the CIA might cut off the flow of sensitive information as it did,  several times in other areas), claiming that the committee could not be trusted  with secrets. &ldquo;It was as if we were on trial&mdash;not the CIA,&rdquo; said a member of the  committee staff. To describe in the committee&rsquo;s final report the true  dimensions of the Agency&rsquo;s use of journalists would cause a furor in the press  and on the Senate floor. And it would result in heavy pressure on the CIA to  end its use of journalists altogether. &ldquo;We just weren&rsquo;t  ready to take that step,&rdquo; said a senator. A similar decision was made to  conceal the results of the staff&rsquo;s inquiry into the use of academics. Bader,  who supervised both areas of inquiry, concurred in the decisions and drafted  those sections of the committee&rsquo;s final report. Pages 191 to 201 were entitled  &ldquo;Covert Relationships with the United States Media.&rdquo; &ldquo;It hardly reflects what  we found,&rdquo; stated Senator Gary Hart. &ldquo;There was a prolonged and elaborate  negotiation [with the CIA] over what would be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obscuring the facts was relatively  simple. No mention was made of the 400 summaries or what they showed. Instead  the report noted blandly that some fifty recent contacts with journalists had  been studied by the committee staff&mdash;thus conveying the impression that the  Agency&rsquo;s dealings with the press had been limited to those instances. The  Agency files, the report noted, contained little evidence that the editorial  content of American news reports had been affected by the CIA&rsquo;s dealings with  journalists. Colby&rsquo;s misleading public statements about the use of journalists  were repeated without serious contradiction or elaboration. The role of  cooperating news executives was given short shrift. The fact that the Agency  had concentrated its relationships in the most prominent sectors of the press  went unmentioned. That the CIA continued to regard the press as up for grabs  was not even suggested.</p>
<p><em>Former &lsquo;Washington Post&rsquo; reporter CARL BERNSTEIN is  now working on a book about the witch hunts of the Cold War.</em></p>
<p><u>Footnotes</u>:</p>
<p>1 John McCone, director of the Agency from 1961 to 1965,  said in a recent interview that he knew about "great deal of debriefing  and exchanging help" but nothing about any arrangements for cover the CIA  might have made with media organizations. "I wouldn't necessarily have  known about it," he said. "Helms would have handled anything like  that. It would be unusual for him to come to me and say, 'We're going to use  journalists for cover.' He had a job to do. There was no policy during my  period that would say, 'Don't go near that water,' nor was there one saying,  'Go to it!'" During the Church committee bearings, McCone testified that  his subordinates failed to tell him about domestic surveillance activities or  that they were working on plans to assassinate Fidel Castro. Richard Helms was  deputy director of the Agency at the time; he became director in 1966.</p>
<p>2 A stringer is a reporter who works for one or several news  organizations on a retainer or on a piecework basis.</p>
<p>3  From the CIA point of view, access to newsfilm  outtakes and photo libraries is a matter of extreme importance. The Agency's  photo archive is probably the greatest on earth; its graphic sources include  satellites, photoreconnaissance, planes, miniature cameras <em>... </em>and the  American press. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Agency obtained carte&#8209;blanche  borrowing privileges in the photo libraries of literally dozens of American  newspapers, magazines and television, outlets. For obvious reasons, the CIA  also assigned high priority to the recruitment of photojournalists,  particularly foreign&#8209;based members of network camera crews.</p>
<p>4  On April 3rd, 1961,  Koop left the Washington bureau  to become head of CBS, Inc.&rsquo;s Government Relations Department &mdash; a position he  held until his retirement on March 31st,  1972.&nbsp; Koop, who worked as a deputy in the Censorship Office in  World War II, continued to deal with the CIA in his new position, according to  CBS sources.</p>
<p>5 Hayes, who left the Washington Post Company in 1965 to become  U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland,  is now chairman of the board of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty &mdash; both of  which severed their ties with the CIA in 1971.&nbsp; Hayes said he  cleared his participation in the China  project with the late Frederick S. Beebe, then chairman of the board of the Washington  Post Company.&nbsp; Katharine Graham, the Post&rsquo;s publisher, was unaware of the  nature of the assignment, he said.&nbsp; Participants in the project signed  secrecy agreements.</p>
<p>6 Philip Geyelin, editor of the <em>Post </em>editorial page, worked for the Agency before joining the <em>Post</em>.</p>
<p>7 Louis Buisch, presidentof  the publishing company of the Hornell, New York, <em>Evening Tribune, </em>told the <em>Courier&#8209;Journal</em> in 1976 that he  remembered little about the hiring of Robert Campbell. "He wasn't there  very long, and he didn't make much of an impression," said Buisch, who has since retired from active management of the  newspaper.</p>
<p>8 Probably the most thoughtful article on the subject of the  press and the CIA was written by Stuart H. Loory and  appeared in the September&#8209;October 1974 issue of <em>Columbia Journalism Review.</em></p>
<p>9  Wes Gallagher, general manager of the Associated Press from 1962 to 1976, takes  vigorous exception to the notion that the Associated Press might have aided the  Agency. "We've always stayed clear on the CIA; I would have fired anybody  who worked for them. We don't even let our people debrief." At the time of  the first disclosures that reporters had worked for the CIA, Gallagher went to  Colby. "We tried to find out names. All he would say was that no full&#8209;time  staff member of the Associated Press was employed by the Agency. We talked to  Bush. He said the same thing." If any Agency personnel were placed in  Associated Press bureaus, said Gallagher, it was done without consulting the  management of the wire service. But Agency officials insist that they were able  to make cover arrangements through someone in the upper management levelsof  Associated Press, whom they refuse to identify.</p>
<p>10 Many journalists and some CIA  officials dispute the Agency's claim that it has been scrupulous in respecting  the editorial integrity of American publications and broadcast outlets.</p>

<p>Web scraping is an essential tool that every developer uses at some point in their career. Hence, it is essential for developers to understand what a web scraper is, as well as how to build one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> defines <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">web scraping</a></em> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <em>web scraping</em> is a process for extracting data from websites and is used in many cases, ranging from data analysis to lead generation. The task can be completed manually or can be automated through a script or software.</p>
<p>There are a variety of use cases for web scraping. Take a look at just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gathering data:</strong> The most useful application or use of web scraping is data gathering. Data is compelling, and analyzing data in the right way can put one company ahead of another. Web scraping is an essential tool for data gathering&mdash;writing a simple script can make data gathering much more accessible and faster than doing manual jobs. Furthermore, the data can also be inputted into a spreadsheet to be better visualized and analyzed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performing market research and lead generation:</strong> Doing market research and generating leads are crucial web scraping tasks. Emails, phone numbers, and other important information from various websites can be scraped and later used for these important tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building price comparison tools:</strong> You might have noticed browser extensions that alert you of a price change for products on e-commerce platforms. Such tools are also built using web scrapers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, you will learn how to create a simple web scraper using <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go</a>.</p>
<p>Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created the Go programming language at Google, and it has been in the market since 2009. Go, also known as Golang, has many brilliant features. Getting started with Go is fast and straightforward. As a result, this comparatively newer language is gaining a lot of attraction in the developer world.</p>
<h2>Implementing Web Scraping with Go</h2>
<p>The support for concurrency has made Go a fast, powerful language, and because the language is easy to get started with, you can build your web scraper with only a few lines of code. For creating web scrapers with Go, two libraries are very popular:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goquery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://go-colly.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Colly</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In this article, you&rsquo;ll be using Colly to implement the scraper. At first, you&rsquo;ll be learning the very basics of building a scraper, and you&rsquo;ll implement a URL scraper from a Wikipedia page. Once you know the basic building blocks of web scraping with Colly, you&rsquo;ll level up the skill and implement a more advanced scraper.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before moving forward in this article, be sure that the following tools and libraries are installed on your computer. You&rsquo;ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic understanding of Go</li>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go</a> (preferably the latest version&mdash;1.17.2, as of writing this article)</li>
<li>IDE or text editor of your choice (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> preferred)</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go extension</a> for the IDE (if available)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Colly and the <code>Collector</code> Component</h3>
<p>The Colly package is used for building web crawlers and scrapers. It is based on Go&rsquo;s Net/HTTP and goquery package. The goquery package gives a jQuery-like syntax in Go to target HTML elements. This package alone is also used to build scrapers.</p>
<p>The main component of Colly is the <code>Collector</code>. According to the <a href="http://go-colly.org/docs/introduction/start/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">docs</a>, the <code>Collector</code> component manages the network communications, and it is also responsible for the callbacks attached to it when a <code>Collector</code> job is running. This component is configurable, and you can modify the <code>UserAgent</code> string or add <code>Authentication</code> headers, restricting or allowing URLs with the help of this component.</p>
<h3>Understanding Colly Callbacks</h3>
<p>Callbacks can also be added to the <code>Collector</code> component. The Colly library has callbacks, such as <code>OnHTML</code> and <code>OnRequest</code>. You can refer to the <a href="http://go-colly.org/docs/introduction/start/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">docs</a> to learn about all the callbacks. These callbacks run at different points in the life cycle of the <code>Collector</code>. For example, the <code>OnRequest</code> callback is run just before the <code>Collector</code> makes an HTTP request.</p>
<p>The <code>OnHTML</code> method is the most common callback used in building web scrapers. It allows registering a callback for the <code>Collector</code> when it reaches a specific HTML tag on the web page.</p>
<h3>Initializing Project Directory and Installing Colly</h3>
<p>Before starting to write code, you have to initialize the project directory. Open the IDE of your choice and open a folder where you will save all your project files. Now, open a terminal window, and locate your directory. After, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code>go mod init github.com/Username/Project-Name
</code></pre></div><p>In the above command, change <code>[github.com](http://github.com)</code> to the domain where you store your files, such as <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitlab</a>. Also, change <code>Username</code> to your username and <code>Project-Name</code> with whatever project name you would like to give it.</p>
<p>Once you type in the command and press enter, you&rsquo;ll find that a new file is created with the name of <code>go.mod</code>. This file holds the information about the direct and indirect dependencies that the project needs. The next step is to install the Colly dependency. To install the dependency, type the following command in the terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code>go get -u github.com/go-colly/colly/...
</code></pre></div><p>This will download the Colly library and will generate a new file called <code>go.sum</code>. You can now find the dependency in the <code>go.mod</code> file. The <code>go.sum</code> file lists the checksum of the direct and indirect dependencies, along with the version. You can read more about the <code>go.sum</code> and <code>go.mod</code> files <a href="https://golangbyexample.com/go-mod-sum-module/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Building a Basic Scraper</h3>
<p>Now that you have set up the project directory with the necessary dependency, you can move forward with writing some codes. The basic scraper aims to scrape all the links from a specific Wikipedia page and print them on the terminal. This scraper is built to make you comfortable with the building blocks of the Colly library.</p>
<p>Create a new file in the folder with an extension of <code>.go</code>&mdash;for example, <code>main.go</code>. All the logic will go into this file. Start by writing <code>package main</code>. This line tells the compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library.</p>
<p>The next step is to start writing the <code>main</code> function. If you are using Visual Studio Code, it will do the importing of the necessary packages automatically. Otherwise, in the case of other IDEs, you may have to do it manually. The <code>Collector</code> of Colly is initialized with the following line of code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>colly</span>.<span>NewCollector</span>(
        <span>colly</span>.<span>AllowedDomains</span>(<span>"en.wikipedia.org"</span>),
    )
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here, the <code>NewCollector</code> is initialized, and as an option, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">en.wikipedia.org</a> is passed as an allowed domain. The same <code>Collector</code> can also be initialized without passing any option to it. Now, if you save the file, Colly will be automatically imported to your <code>main.go</code> file; if not, add the following lines after the <code>package main</code> line:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>

    <span>"github.com/gocolly/colly"</span>
) 
</code></pre></div><p>The above lines import two packages in the <code>main.go</code> file. The first package is the <code>fmt</code> package, and the second one is the Colly library.</p>
<p>Now, open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this URL</a> in your browser. This is the Wikipedia page on web scraping. The web scraper is going to scrape all the links from this page. Understanding the browser developer tools well is an invaluable skill in web scraping. Open the browser inspect tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting <strong>Inspect</strong>. This will open the page inspector. You&rsquo;ll be able to see the whole HTML, CSS, network calls, and other important information from here. For this example specifically, find the <code>mw-parser-output</code> div:</p>






















<div>
  
  <p><img alt="Wikipedia in Dev Tools">
  
</p></div>

<br>


<p>This div element contains the body of the page. Targeting the links inside this div will provide all the links used inside the article.</p>
<p>Next, you will use the <code>OnHTML</code> method. Here is the remaining code for the scraper:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// Find and print all links
</span><span></span>    <span>c</span>.<span>OnHTML</span>(<span>".mw-parser-output"</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>e</span> <span>*</span><span>colly</span>.<span>HTMLElement</span>) {
        <span>links</span> <span>:=</span> <span>e</span>.<span>ChildAttrs</span>(<span>"a"</span>, <span>"href"</span>)
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>links</span>)
    })
    <span>c</span>.<span>Visit</span>(<span>"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping"</span>) 
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>OnHTML</code> method takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the HTML element. Reaching it is going to execute the callback function, which is passed as the second parameter. Inside the callback function, the <code>links</code> variable is assigned to a method that returns all the child attributes matching the element&rsquo;s attributes. The <code>e.ChildAttrs("a", "href")</code> function <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gocolly/colly?utm_source=godoc#HTMLElement.ChildAttrs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">returns</a> a slice of strings of all the links inside the <code>mw-parser-output</code> div. The <code>fmt.Println(links)</code> function prints the links in the terminal.</p>
<p>Finally, visit the URL using the <code>c.Visit("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping")</code> command. The complete scraper code will look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>

    <span>"github.com/gocolly/colly"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>colly</span>.<span>NewCollector</span>(
        <span>colly</span>.<span>AllowedDomains</span>(<span>"en.wikipedia.org"</span>),
    )

    <span>// Find and print all links
</span><span></span>    <span>c</span>.<span>OnHTML</span>(<span>".mw-parser-output"</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>e</span> <span>*</span><span>colly</span>.<span>HTMLElement</span>) {

<h3>Scraping Table Data</h3>






















<div>
  
  <p><img alt="W3Schools HTML Table">
  
</p></div>

<br>


<p>To scrape the table data, you can either remove the codes you have written inside <code>c.OnHTML</code> or create a new project by following the same steps mentioned above. To make and write a CSV file, you&rsquo;ll be using the <code>encoding/csv</code> library available in Go. Here is the starter code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"encoding/csv"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"os"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>fName</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"data.csv"</span>
    <span>file</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>os</span>.<span>Create</span>(<span>fName</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>log</span>.<span>Fatalf</span>(<span>"Could not create file, err: %q"</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>file</span>.<span>Close</span>()

    <span>writer</span> <span>:=</span> <span>csv</span>.<span>NewWriter</span>(<span>file</span>)
    <span>defer</span> <span>writer</span>.<span>Flush</span>()
}
</code></pre></div><p>Inside the <code>main</code> function, the first action is to define the file name. Here, it is defined as <code>data.csv</code>. Then using the <code>os.Create(fName)</code> method, the file is created with the name <code>data.csv</code>. If any error occurs during the creation of the file, it&rsquo;ll also log the error and exit the program. The <code>defer file.Close()</code> command will close the file when the surrounding function returns.</p>
<p>The <code>writer := csv.NewWriter(file)</code> command initializes the CSV writer to write to the file, and the <code>writer.Flush()</code> will throw everything from the buffer to the writer.</p>
<p>Once the file creation process is done, the scraping process can be started. This is similar to the above example.</p>
<p>Next, add the below lines of code after the <code>defer writer.Flush()</code> line ends:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>colly</span>.<span>NewCollector</span>()
    <span>c</span>.<span>OnHTML</span>(<span>"table#customers"</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>e</span> <span>*</span><span>colly</span>.<span>HTMLElement</span>) {
        <span>e</span>.<span>ForEach</span>(<span>"tr"</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>_</span> <span>int</span>, <span>el</span> <span>*</span><span>colly</span>.<span>HTMLElement</span>) {
            <span>writer</span>.<span>Write</span>([]<span>string</span>{
                <span>el</span>.<span>ChildText</span>(<span>"td:nth-child(1)"</span>),
                <span>el</span>.<span>ChildText</span>(<span>"td:nth-child(2)"</span>),
                <span>el</span>.<span>ChildText</span>(<span>"td:nth-child(3)"</span>),
            })
        })
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Scrapping Complete"</span>)
    })
    <span>c</span>.<span>Visit</span>(<span>"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>In this code, Colly is being initialized. Colly uses the <code>ForEach</code> method to iterate through the content. Because the table has three columns or <code>td</code> elements, using the <code>nth-child</code> pseudo selector, three columns are selected. <code>el.ChildText</code> returns the text inside the element. Putting it inside the <code>writer.Write</code> method will write the elements into the CSV file. Finally, the print statement prints a message when the scraping is complete. Because this code is not targeting the table headers, it will not print the heading. The complete code for this scraper will be like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"encoding/csv"</span>
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>

    <span>"github.com/gocolly/colly"</span>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, you learned what web scrapers are as well as some use cases and how they can be implemented with Go, with the help of the Colly library.</p>
<p>However, the methods described in this tutorial are not the only possible way of implementing a scraper. Consider experimenting with this yourself and finding new ways to do it. Colly can also work together with the goquery library to make a more powerful scraper.</p>
<p>Depending on your use case, you can modify Colly to satisfy your needs. Web scraping is very handy for keyword research, brand protection, promotion, website testing, and many other things. So knowing how to build your own web scraper can help you become a better developer.</p>

<h4><strong>Whilst the European Parliament <a href="https://reclaimyourface.eu/our-voices-have-been-heard-ep-calls-to-ban-bms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been fighting bravely</a> for the rights of everyone in the EU to exist freely and with dignity in publicly accessible spaces, the government of Portugal is attempting to push their country in the opposite direction: one of digital authoritarianism.</strong></h4>







<p>The Portuguese lead organisation in the Reclaim Your Face coalition <a href="https://direitosdigitais.pt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D3 (Defesa Dos Direitos Digitais</a>) are raising awareness of how the Portuguese government&rsquo;s new proposed video surveillance and facial recognition law amounts to illiberal biometric mass surveillance. Why? <strong>Ministers are trying to secretly rush the law through the Parliament, endangering the very foundations of democracy on which the Republic of Portugal rests.</strong></p>



<p>Eerily reminiscent of the <a href="https://reclaimyourface.eu/serbia-withdraws-a-proposed-biometric-surveillance-bill-following-national-and-international-pressure/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">failed attempts by the Serbian government</a> just two months ago to rush in a biometric mass surveillance law, Portugal now asked its Parliament to approve a law in a shocking absence of democratic scrutiny. Just two weeks before the national Assembly will be dissolved, the government wants Parliamentarians to quickly approve a law, without public consultation or evidence. <strong>The law would enable and encourage widespread biometric mass surveillance &ndash; even though we have repeatedly shown just how harmful these practices are.</strong></p>



<p>Reclaim Your Face lead organisation <a href="https://edri.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EDRi</a> sent a letter to representatives of Portugal&rsquo;s main political parties, supporting D3&rsquo;s fight against biometric mass surveillance practices that treat each and every person as a potential criminal. Together, we urged politicians to reject this dystopian law.</p>



<p>Read EDRi&rsquo;s letter below.</p>

<hr>



<h5> <h5> <br><b><u>Re: Serious fundamental rights concerns about proposed Portuguese video surveillance Law 111/XIV/2</u></b>
</h5></h5><p>
I am writing to you and your colleagues on behalf of <a href="https://edri.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Digital Rights (EDRi)</a>, a network of 45 digital human rights groups from across Europe, including <a href="https://direitosdigitais.pt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D3 &ndash; Defesa dos Direitos Digitais</a>, <b>to urge you to oppose this proposed law.</b></p><p>
We want to express our deep concern about the <b><u>Proposed Law 111/XIV/2 on the use of video surveillance by security forces and services</u></b>. Despite providing <b>no evidence of effectiveness, necessity or proportionality of these measures</b>, the proposal puts forward <b>sweeping measures which would permit the constant video and biometric mass surveillance of each and every person.</b></p><p>There are many reasons why this proposal is likely to be <b>incompatible with the essence of Portugal&rsquo;s constitutional obligations to ensure that restrictions on fundamental rights are necessary and proportionate</b> (article 18/2); with Portugal&rsquo;s <b>obligations under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</b> (including but not limited to articles 1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 20, 21, 41, 47, 48 and 49); and the <b>European Convention on Human Rights</b> (ECHR). </p><p>The proposed law 111/XIV/2:</p><p>
<b>1.Removes current legal safeguards limiting the use of invasive video surveillance</b>, such that the permanent and nearly omnipresent use of these systems in publicly accessible spaces may be permitted;</p><p>
<b>2.Permits video surveillance by aerial drones without limits</b>, further creating possibilities for the pervasive public surveillance; and</p><p>
<b>3.Establishes that these vast video surveillance networks may be combined with facial recognition and other AI-based systems in public spaces</b>. Such practices enable the omnipotent tracking of individuals, and can thus unduly interfere with a wide range of people&rsquo;s rights including to: privacy and data protection; as well as to express, associate and assemble freely; to have respect for their rights to equality, non-discrimination and dignity; as well as rights to the presumption of innocence and other due process rights.</p><p>
       
<b><u>Furthermore, the proposal recklessly removes existing safeguards:</u></b></p><p>
Law 111/XIV/2 proposes to withdraw vital powers from the national data protection authority</p>, the Comiss&atilde;o Nacional de Protec&ccedil;&atilde;o de Dados (CNPD). This means that not only has the government proposed measures which contradict Portugal&rsquo;s data protection obligations, but that <b>the very authorities designated to protect people&rsquo;s from undue violations of their rights will be deliberately prevented from being able to carry out their vital public duties</b>. <a href="https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/pais/protecao-de-dados-arrasa-proposta-sobre-videovigilancia-para-policias_v1361878" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The CNPD have called this proposal a &ldquo;gross violation of the principle of proportionality&rdquo;</a> and have emphasised that it is likely incompatible with the Portuguese Constitution.<p>
<b><u>The proposal enables biometric mass surveillance practices:</u></b></p><p>
The combined effect of these measures would be highly likely to <b>unduly restrict the rights and freedoms of large parts of the Portuguese population and to constitute unjustified biometric mass surveillance practices</b>. Such measures treat each person as a potential suspect, and they obscure the possibility of targeted use, as passers-by are an inherent feature of public spaces. Over 63.000 EU citizens have already objected to these practices via the Reclaim Your Face campaign, including close to 750 Portuguese nationals.<br>
The Italian Data Protection Authority has further confirmed that <b><a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9575842" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uses of facial recognition and other biometric identification in public spaces constitutes mass surveillance</a></b>, even when authorities are searching for specific individuals on a watch-list. This is because, as the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and Board (EDPB) have emphasised, <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/opinions/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-proposal-regulation-european_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the personal data and privacy of anyone passing through that space is unduly infringed upon by such surveillance.</a></p><p>
Another particular risk arises from the fact that the proposal requires the processing of especially sensitive data. People&rsquo;s biometric data, such as their faces, are central to their personal identity and sometimes their protected characteristics. Their processing can therefore infringe on rights to dignity, equality and non-discrimination, autonomy and self-determination.</p><p>

<b><u>The proposal is at odds with the European Parliament and the United Nations:</u></b></p><p>

The proposed law stands in direct contradiction to the <a href="https://reclaimyourface.eu/our-voices-have-been-heard-ep-calls-to-ban-bms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">position of the European Parliament, which voted in October 2021 to adopt the &lsquo;AI and criminal law&rsquo; report</a>. This official report call to ban biometric mass surveillance, including of the kind that is being proposed in law 111/XIV/2. Other EU opposition to such practices includes the proposed ban on real-time remote biometric identification (RBI) by law enforcement in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EU&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, and a call from the EDPS and EDPB to implement a <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/2021-06-18-edpb-edps_joint_opinion_ai_regulation_en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;general ban any use of AI for an automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible space.&rdquo;</a></p><p>
                          
The need to prohibit, rather than legalise, such practices has also been confirmed by <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27469&amp;LangID=E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who warned</a> that it <i>&ldquo;dramatically increases the ability of State authorities to systematically identity and track individuals in public spaces, undermining the ability of people to go about their lives unobserved&rdquo; and should therefore be limited or banned.</i></p><p>

<b><u>The proposal undermines the essence of a democratic society:</u></b></p><p>

Mass surveillance is not just bad for individuals, but also for communities. The landmark <a href="https://www.bverfg.de/e/rs19831215_1bvr020983.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Census judgement</a> of the German Constitutional Court articulated the <b>threats not only to people&rsquo;s political rights and civil rights, but also to democracy and &ldquo;the common good, because self-determination [which is harmed by mass surveillance] is an essential prerequisite for a free and democratic society that is based on the capacity and solidarity of its citizens.&rdquo;</b></p><p>

European and international human rights groups have raised <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Paper-Ban-Biometric-Mass-Surveillance.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the severe harms of biometric mass surveillance.</a> Constant, invasive surveillance <b>disincentivises people from protesting; suppresses anti-corruption efforts by making it harder for sources to blow the whistle anonymously</b>; and has <b>a general chilling effect on people&rsquo;s rights and freedoms.</b> Biometric mass surveillance systems have been used across Europe and the world to spy on groups including human rights defenders, <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/new-edri-report-reveals-depths-of-biometric-mass-surveillance-in-germany-the-netherlands-and-poland/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LGBT+ communities and people going to church.</a></p><p>
Lastly, the <b>hurried manner in which this proposal has been brought forward is grave cause for concern.</b> With the upcoming dissolution of the Portuguese Parliamentary Assembly, the government aims to push through this rights-violating proposal in a rushed manner and without public consultation. This prevents proper democratic scrutiny of the proposal and will undermine people&rsquo;s trust in the legislative process.</p><p>
<b>We urge you to consider the rights and freedoms of the people of Portugal and your obligations under constitutional, EU and international law, to reject the proposed video surveillance law 111/XIV/2.</b> We are at your disposal should you wish to discuss any of the above.
</p><p>
Yours sincerely, Diego Naranjo
<br>
Head of Policy, EDRi </p>

<h2>
You&rsquo;d think a generation of folks raised on making look-at-me posts on social media could never go work at the Agency. You&rsquo;d be wrong. </h2>

 </div>
</span></p><div>
<p><strong>When you pull up to the CIA headquarters in Langley</strong>, you have to shout your Social Security number out the window into a speaker, like when you&rsquo;re ordering fries at a drive-through. Much like the Union that the Agency was formed to protect, the system, it seems, could be more perfect. But I am willing to do what it takes to get the inside story of how the CIA is recruiting and working with the next generation of spies.</p>
<p>One would think it&rsquo;s basically impossible to get millennials and zoomers into covert jobs. The youngest of this bunch of young people have spent their entire lives online, some since their parents blasted out their first ultrasound picture as a pregnancy announcement, before they&rsquo;d even gained sentience. If the whole point of being a spy is that nobody knows who you really are and no one can ever find out, how exactly are you supposed to achieve this level of anonymity when you&rsquo;ve flung untold reams of identifiable content across the digital world? I intended to find out.</p>
<p>So I made it through the visitor center (leaving my phone behind in a locker), drove past what I&rsquo;m told is a very contentious parking situation where lots of spots are so far from the office that a shuttle has to transport employees from their cars to their desks (a spy&rsquo;s supposedly glamorous life actually laced with drudgery and inconvenience&mdash;how very John le Carr&eacute;), up to the Original Headquarters Building, with its bright, imposing marble lobby (the one you&rsquo;ve seen on TV, with the CIA seal in floor tile and the memorial stars carved into the wall), down a hall lined with photos and well-wishes from past Presidents (Trump&rsquo;s thick Sharpie scrawl, visible from afar, shouts in all-caps, &ldquo;I&rsquo;M VERY PROUD OF YOU! YOU ARE THE WORLD&rsquo;S BEST!&rdquo;), and through a museum, where items on display include a gun swiped during the bin Laden raid and the gym bag of a young woman who died on Flight 93, her luggage tags from 9/11/01 still attached.</p>
<figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" src="https://www.washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" srcset="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Photograph by CIA/Alamy Stock Photo.</figcaption></figure>
<p>My meeting with Michael T. Burns, associate director for CIA talent, took place in the Office of Public Affairs conference room, a windowless space that, hilariously, is decorated with framed posters of spy movies and TV shows: John Krasinski as Jack Ryan, Daniel Craig as James Bond, a black-and-white photo of <em>The Americans</em> cast doing a panel, alongside CIA formers, called &ldquo;Reel Life vs. Real Life.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m told, many times by many people, that Hollywood portrayals of Langley and of spycraft more broadly are wildly misleading and totally inaccurate&mdash;&ldquo;Everyone thinks it&rsquo;s like <em>24</em>, but it&rsquo;s really more like <em>The Office</em>,&rdquo; Burns joked&mdash;but evidently these depictions don&rsquo;t bother them too much.</p>
<p>Before I arrived, I&rsquo;d had a decent number of people say they couldn&rsquo;t tell me much about how the CIA chooses its young new recruits. But surprisingly, I&rsquo;d also heard that online footprints don&rsquo;t necessarily eighty-six your chances. &ldquo;Most folks that are applying to jobs in the intelligence community have kind of prepared themselves and their portfolios and lifestyles for such an application,&rdquo; Lisa Maddox, who worked at the CIA from 2008 to 2018, told me. They&rsquo;re shrewd enough either to be circumspect users of social media from the start or to review (and delete) old problematic tweets and posts. Plus, &ldquo;the CIA is a pretty modern, savvy organization,&rdquo; Maddox said. &ldquo;They want and encourage most officers to have a social-media presence because, quite frankly, it&rsquo;s a red flag and it looks strange if you don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve got to blend in and look normal.&rdquo; Actually, she speculated, &ldquo;I would argue that some of the Gen Z&ndash;and-younger folks, their networks are so huge online, it&rsquo;s almost a blessing. You can&rsquo;t figure out who their close friends are because they&rsquo;re friends with everybody. It almost negates the exposure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could this really be true?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social media is not a huge deal at all,&rdquo; Burns said as we settled in across from each other at the conference table. Burns has been at the Agency more than 30 years and has the warm and amiable manner of the coach who wants to make sure everybody gets some playing time. He was very keen that I (and, by extension, all millennial and Gen Z readers of this magazine) understand that you do not need to lead a totally offline life to qualify for covert work. In fact, if you are active online, he warned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t abandon your social media the minute you start working here.&rdquo; (Also: Don&rsquo;t do crimes and &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you work here.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Burns explained the application process like so: When would-be spies (a.k.a. case officers) apply for jobs, they have no idea if their role will involve covert work or not. If your application&mdash;r&eacute;sum&eacute;, writing samples, standard-issue government-job stuff&mdash;passes muster, you take a personality test, which is handled by in-house psychologists who make determinations about your judgment, your ability to collaborate, and other &ldquo;softer skills.&rdquo; If you say you speak any other languages, you&rsquo;re tested on that proficiency as well.</p>
<p>Then comes an interview. Where do the interviews take place? &ldquo;We will tell the applicant,&rdquo; said Burns, meaning he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me. A conditional offer of employment becomes official once you pass a security clearance, which, as the initiated know, can take up to a year&mdash;a year!&mdash;during which you can go live your life, again without committing any felonies or updating your Twitter bio to say &ldquo;CIA hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing, <em>nota bene</em>, which I learned from a helpful How We Hire page on the agency&rsquo;s website: &ldquo;For your security, if you are interested in or have applied for a job at CIA, do not follow us on social media.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Naturally, I asked if I could take the personality test. They said</strong> no, so I guess we&rsquo;ll never know if I&rsquo;m too unstable for spycraft. Nor did I get to take a polygraph, which a millennial CIA analyst who joined the Agency less than five years ago told me via email was a very concerning part of the process, &ldquo;especially since I applied right after college! I was nervous that the Agency wanted a certain kind of person and that I wouldn&rsquo;t fit the mold.&rdquo; This analyst was also a bit concerned about how they could still use social media to support certain causes without violating the Hatch Act, the law that bars federal workers from going all in on partisan activities. But after they had a sit-down with an Agency attorney to talk it out, all was well&mdash;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t post about the Agency, I don&rsquo;t advocate for or against any particular political parties, and I&rsquo;m extra-careful about my privacy settings.&rdquo; (Side note: Though you&rsquo;d think a person accustomed to being super-active on the group chat would struggle with being separated from their phone all day, this analyst assured me, &ldquo;The mission is so dynamic that you&rsquo;ll rarely, if ever, be bored, and the longing for your phone and social media sort of dissipates.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Okay, so just for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say the Agency doesn&rsquo;t mind at all that I&rsquo;ve immortalized some of my tackiest Halloween costumes on Instagram and may or may not have posted the results of multiple BuzzFeed &ldquo;Which Gossip Girl Character Are You?&rdquo; personality quizzes on Facebook. And I, too, have made it through the recruitment process. I&rsquo;m given an assignment as a case officer. Time to go undercover.</p>
<p>I asked Michael T. Burns: If you give me a fake name, but meanwhile I already have this whole online life where I go by my real name, can&rsquo;t somebody just take my picture, reverse-Google-image-search it, and blow my cover? &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t give people fake names in most cases,&rdquo; Burns said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about not having an association with the Agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed not to be getting an alias and a disguise&mdash;I was hoping wigs would be involved, like maybe Keri Russell&rsquo;s season-six redhead-with-bangs&mdash;but it turns out that, in spycraft as in life, the truth is the best lie. &ldquo;We incorporate aliases consistent with biometric realities,&rdquo; said Douglas London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA&rsquo;s Clandestine Service, the elite branch that runs all of the Agency&rsquo;s undercover operations.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>The beauty of this system, of course, is that, were a person to go ahead and Google me, everything they&rsquo;d find online would track with the cover I&rsquo;ve given. The downside, so far as I can see, is that I am (apparently) holding down two rather demanding jobs.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>&ldquo;Cover is best tailored to reality,&rdquo; London explained. &ldquo;[And] you shape your own persona to suit cover. So it could actually be something you leverage&mdash;you leverage your existing profile to suit your cover requirements. So it&rsquo;s absolutely not a nonstarter [to be on social media], unless there&rsquo;s things on your social media that expose what might be considered weaknesses or vulnerabilities, like a party shot of you throwing down a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black. But it&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker, and the smart case officer uses their public persona to their advantage to support their cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s cover for status&mdash;e.g., saying you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;Foreign Service officer&rdquo; to justify your presence in whatever country you&rsquo;re operating in&mdash;and cover for action, which is why you&rsquo;re up to what you&rsquo;re up to, in the moment. London offered this example, in which I&rsquo;m still a spy: &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re Jessica Goldstein and you&rsquo;re in Prague and you&rsquo;re working for <em>Washingtonian</em> magazine&mdash;that&rsquo;s really who you are! That&rsquo;s legit. While you&rsquo;re in Prague, you would be clandestinely meeting some senior official from the foreign ministry, and at the site of that meeting, if someone approaches you, you might [say], &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m meeting my boyfriend&mdash;we&rsquo;re going dancing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re in this shady neighborhood because I&rsquo;m trading currency outside the banks, or buying something black-market.&rsquo; . . . But your cover in status is really who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beauty of this system, of course, is that, were a person to go ahead and Google me, everything they&rsquo;d find online would track with the cover I&rsquo;ve given. The downside, so far as I can see, is that I am (apparently) holding down two rather demanding jobs.</p>
<p>Most of the CIA&rsquo;s spies are not running around telling people they&rsquo;re reporters just enjoying a night out with a hot date in Hole&scaron;ovice. (Or are they?) My editor, for one, assures me he doesn&rsquo;t have a Prague correspondent and he suspects that any half-competent enemy intelligence agency would think there&rsquo;s something fishy about a Washington-area lifestyle magazine assigning someone to the Czech Republic. And I do have it on good authority that he&rsquo;s right; the CIA doesn&rsquo;t really like its spies to pretend being reporters. Typically, &ldquo;a lot of them are going to be passing off as diplomats for the State Department,&rdquo; said Andrew Hammond, historian and curator at the International Spy Museum, &ldquo;so as long as there&rsquo;s a digital footprint that supports that cover identity, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What about the extraordinary cases in which fake identities are required? For this, I consulted the expert of all experts: Jonna Mendez, former chief of disguise in the CIA&rsquo;s Office of Technical Service. (For the Bond fans out there, she was our Q.) &ldquo;The fact is that we have always been using deception, whatever form it would take, to allow our operating officers to go out under false names,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The need has never changed. So many places in the world, and so many operational acts, can only be done in another identity.&rdquo; What has changed is the playing field: What used to need to work only in an analog capacity now has to transfer to cyberspace as well.</p>
<p>Mendez theorized that there could be a way to futz with an online presence temporarily, for cover purposes: &ldquo;You might want to say, &lsquo;Maybe let&rsquo;s keep the pictures, and I could rewrite my history. Here I am with some school chums, but I&rsquo;m not in this state or country, I&rsquo;m in that state or country.&rsquo; You probably only do that on a temporary basis, and then when you don&rsquo;t need that [narrative], you flip it back to your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She mentioned a mission involving her husband, fellow former CIA officer Tony Mendez, which you likely know about because he&rsquo;s the guy <em>Argo</em> is based on and this scene is in the movie. Remember when Ben Affleck&ndash;as-Tony gives a business card with an LA phone number to an immigration officer challenging his story? And the officer dials the number and someone picks up the phone to say, &ldquo;Studio 6 productions, may I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was called backstopping,&rdquo; Mendez said. &ldquo;And now . . . we transfer these capabilities into a digital world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t know exactly how the CIA backstops now, and even if she did, she wouldn&rsquo;t tell. But she doesn&rsquo;t doubt there are ways, given the capabilities of the disguise department during her tenure, which ended in 1993. &ldquo;We could do almost anything with disguise by the time I left,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We could change you into specifically another person or generally another person. We could change your gender. We could change your ethnicity. We could change your skin tone. We could change your nationality. We could turn you into anything, or we could turn you into another you, so there could be two of you if that would be useful.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Okay, so young people who want to work at the CIA need not</strong> fear that their TikToks render them unemployable. But do young people even want to work at the CIA?</p>
<p>The Agency knows it has a, shall we say, image problem, with its youngest potential recruits&mdash;some of whom are younger than the war in Afghanistan and many of whom, as a cohort, are more skeptical of institutions&mdash;wary of the work the United States government and military undertake, and suspicious of the means with which they execute those missions. It&rsquo;s not an unprecedented wave of antiestablishment sentiment. College students were famously among the most vocal opponents of the Agency during the Vietnam War, and the CIA responded to their criticism . . . by spying on them in what the <em>New York Times</em> would later reveal was a massive, illegal intelligence operation.</p>
<p>But this more recent skepticism and scrutiny are hitting at a time when intelligence agencies are facing intense competition from filthy-rich tech companies for future hires. Even though the CIA saw a major surge in applications in the immediate wake of September 11 (it received three times as many r&eacute;sum&eacute;s in 2002 as it did in 2001), that fervor faded as the war on terror dragged on and reporting exposed the unsettling contours of the CIA&rsquo;s tactics. A 2018 Pew study found that only 47 percent of millennials agree that the intelligence community &ldquo;plays a vital role in protecting the country,&rdquo; compared with 78 percent of respondents in their grandparents&rsquo; generation. According to an earlier Pew study, millennials also hold more critical views of the CIA&rsquo;s post-9/11 interrogation methods, including its use of so-called black sites to hold, question, and, in some cases, torture individuals suspected of terrorism.</p>
<p>At the same time, the brass knows it needs to diversify the ranks. Langley was historically lousy with WASPy white guys&mdash;mostly Yalies, though Princetonians would do&mdash;who, in turn, focused their recruitment efforts on young men just like them. Only six years ago, in 2015, civil-rights activist Vernon Jordan chaired a study on diversity for then&ndash;CIA chief John Brennan, which found that &ldquo;over the past twenty years&mdash;in several critical areas&mdash;the senior leadership of the CIA has become less diverse. . . . The Agency&rsquo;s workforce is not diverse . . . . In fact, the more senior the Agency&rsquo;s workforce is, the less diverse it is.&rdquo; Demographic data from four years after that (2019), collected by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, revealed that intelligence agencies were still behind the federal and civil workforce in minority representation and that the spy agencies&rsquo; head counts were 61 percent male, 39 percent female.</p>
<p>Given the ever-sprawling nature of America&rsquo;s intelligence missions, how can the CIA court allies and catch terrorists without case officers who can blend in anywhere and connect with people of all backgrounds and creeds? Burns, who wore a Virginia Tech lanyard around his neck during our interview (he earned his bachelor&rsquo;s there), said the Agency aims to improve in this department, and he cited its outreach to historically Black colleges and universities as one example of that effort. The CIA has started bringing younger officers on college visits, too, so recruits can &ldquo;see themselves&rdquo; in the Agency.</p>
<figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2112px) 100vw, 2112px" src="https://www.washingtonian.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" srcset="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Photographs by Istock, Pexels, and Unsplash.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Because most of us&mdash;possible future spies included&mdash;spend most of our time looking at our phones, the CIA also zhuzhed up its online presence and finally joined the rest of us on social media. In 2014, @CIA practically broke Twitter with a zinger of an introduction: &ldquo;We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.&rdquo; The Agency joined Facebook, too. The feeds don&rsquo;t exactly dish out <em>Argo</em>-style capers&mdash;it&rsquo;s mostly job postings and archival bits that make for slightly better reading than a government white paper. (It has just over a million followers on Facebook and 3.2 million on Twitter.) But the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@cia</a> you see on Instagram is a little voicier and a little more personal.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the trio of millennials who reportedly work on that account unveiled a Humans of CIA campaign, inspired by the popular Humans of New York photo series. Pics of actual employees and officers, their faces typically shielded from view, appear alongside first-person stories about the work they do and why. It&rsquo;s fairly predictable, proud-to-serve stuff, although headquarters has apparently given its blessing to some cutesier content, too. One hashtag series, #LoveAtLangley, featured stories of employees who fell in love with their fellow officers. (No lie, it was pegged to Valentine&rsquo;s Day.)</p>
<p>Traction on the account&mdash;it&rsquo;s got 406,000 followers&mdash;is just okay. The FBI has 1.9 million, and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff has a million. Although plenty of people were paying attention this past spring when @cia released a video spot about an Agency employee named Mija who ID&rsquo;d herself as &ldquo;a woman of color,&rdquo; &ldquo;a mom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a cisgender millennial who&rsquo;s been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.&rdquo; The clip was intended to showcase the inclusive nature of the CIA but was roundly mocked across the internet. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a Chinese communist, or an Iranian Mullah, or Kim Jong Un&hellip;would this scare you? We&rsquo;ve come a long way from Jason Bourne,&rdquo; tweeted GOP senator Ted Cruz, who apparently didn&rsquo;t get the memo about the CIA being more like <em>The Office</em> than<em> 24</em> (or else spent too much time staring at the posters in Burns&rsquo;s conference room). Trevor Noah devoted a <em>Daily Show</em> segment to the spot, asking, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re such good spies, shouldn&rsquo;t you already know who you should hire?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Even <a href="https://www.cia.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CIA.gov</a> got a new look. Headquarters relaunched the website this year, and it now bears all the visual signifiers of a millennial- and Gen Z&ndash;friendly organization: sans-serif font, slick new logo, and dog-training advice (presumably because some millennial-whisperer told them that puppies always do numbers online). Job listings on the site include information about starting salaries; the Agency is even posting openings on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The charm offensive hasn&rsquo;t won over the most progressive and extremely online young people&mdash;a typical take, from Refinery29, accused Langley of &ldquo;using trendy aesthetics&rdquo; to &ldquo;veil what they truly operate and exist to do . . . to impose violence on both Americans and people in other countries.&rdquo; But, by perhaps the most important metric, these efforts are resonating. A CIA spokesperson told me that its 2021 class is &ldquo;the third-largest in a decade and represents the most diverse talent pool, including persons with disabilities, since 2010.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the qualities the Agency is looking for in spies, I have to admit that even without knowing how well I&rsquo;d do on the psych exam, I&rsquo;m probably not the recruit they&rsquo;re looking for. You&rsquo;re reading this story in the only language I speak fluently. My cyber-savvy pretty much begins and ends at &ldquo;Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?&rdquo; Probably for the best to stick with the job I&rsquo;ve already got.</p>
<p>Or maybe that&rsquo;s just my cover.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER 1: Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The aim of this report is to establish a problematised overview of what we know about what is currently being done in Europe when it comes to remote biometric identification (RBI), and to assess in which cases we could potentially fall into forms of biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Private and public actors are increasingly deploying &ldquo;smart surveillance&rdquo; solutions including RBI technologies which, if left unchecked, could become biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Facial recognition technology has been the most discussed of the RBI technologies. However, there seems to be little understanding of the ways in which this technology might be applied and the potential impact of such a broad range of applications on the fundamental rights of European citizens.</p></li>
<li><p>The development of RBI systems by authoritarian regimes which may subsequently be exported to and used within Europe is of concern. Not only as it pertains to the deployments of such technologies but also the lack of adequate insight into the privacy practices of the companies supplying the systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Four main positions have emerged among political actors with regard to the deployments of RBI technologies and their potential impact on fundamental rights: 1) active promotion 2) support with safeguards; 3) moratorium and 4) outright ban.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 2: Technical Overview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current market of RBI systems is overwhelmingly dominated by image-based products, at the centre of which is facial recognition technology (FRT). Other products such as face detection and person detection technologies are also in use.</p></li>
<li><p>FRT is typically being deployed to perform two types of searches: cooperative searches for verification and/ or authentication purposes, and non-cooperative searches to identify a data subject. The former involves voluntary consent from the data subject to capture their image, while the latter may not.</p></li>
<li><p>Live facial recognition is currently the most controversial deployment of FRT: Live video feeds are used to generate snapshots of individuals and then match them against a database of known individuals &ndash; the &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Other RBI technologies are being deployed though their use at present is marginal compared to FRT, these include gait (movement), audio, and emotion recognition technologies, amongst others.</p></li>
<li><p>A better understanding of the technical components and possible usage applications of image-based RBI technologies is needed in order to assess their potential political implications.</p></li>
<li><p>RBI technologies are subject to technical challenges and limitations which should be considered in any broader analysis of their ethical, legal, and political implications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 3: Overview of deployments in Europe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Current deployments of RBI technologies within Europe are primarily experimental and localised. However, the technology coexists with a broad range of algorithmic processing of security images being carried out on a scale which ranges from the individual level to what could be classed as biometric mass surveillance. Distinguishing the various characteristics of these deployments is not only important to inform the public debate, but also helps to focus the discussion on the most problematic uses of the technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Image and sound-based security applications being used for authentication purposes do not currently pose a risk for biometric mass surveillance.&nbsp;However, it should be noted that an alteration to the legal framework could increase the risk of them being deployed for biometric mass surveillance especially as many of the databases being used contain millions of data subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to authentication, image and sound-based security applications are being deployed for surveillance. Surveillance applications include the deployment of RBI in public spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress on two fronts makes the development of biometric mass surveillance more than a remote possibility. Firstly, the current creation and/or upgrading of biometric databases being used in civil and criminal registries. Secondly, the repeated piloting of live-feed systems connected to remote facial and biometric information search and recognition algorithms. &nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 4: Legal bases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of biometric tools for law enforcement purposes in public spaces raises a key issue of the legal permissibility in relation to the collection, retention and processing of data when considering the individual&rsquo;s fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection. When viewed through this lens, RBI technologies could have a grave impact on the exercise of a range of fundamental rights.</p></li>
<li><p>The deployment of biometric surveillance in public spaces must be subject to strict scrutiny in order to avoid circumstances which could lead to mass surveillance. This includes targeted surveillance which has the potential for indiscriminate collection of data on any persons present in the surveilled location, not only that of the target data subject.</p></li>
<li><p>The normative legal framework for conducting biometric surveillance in public spaces can be found in the EU secondary legislation on data protection (GDPR and LED). The use of biometric data under this framework must be reviewed in light of the protection offered by fundamental rights.</p></li>
<li><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s April 2021 proposal on the Regulation for the Artificial Intelligence Act aims to harmonise regulatory rules for Member States on AI-based systems. The Proposed Regulation lays out rules focused on three categories of risks (unacceptable, high, and low/ minimal risk) and anticipates covering the use of RBI systems. It also aims to compliment the rules and obligations set out in the GDPR and LED.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CHAPTER 5: Political developments and main issues of contention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four main positions on RBI systems have emerged among political actors as a result of both technical developments in the field and early legislative activity of EU institutions:&nbsp;1) active promotion 2) support with safeguards; 3) moratorium and 4) outright ban.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who are in favour of support with safeguards argue that the deployment RBI technologies should be strictly monitored because of the potential risks they pose, including the potential danger of FRT, for example, to contribute to the further criminalisation or stigmatisation of groups of people who already face discrimination.</p></li>
<li><p>The European Parliament passed a resolution on artificial intelligence in January 2020 in which they invite the Commission &ldquo;to assess the consequences of a moratorium on the use of facial recognition systems&rdquo;. If deemed necessary, such a moratorium could impact some existing uses of FRT including its deployment in public spaces by public authorities.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of EU and national NGOs have called for an outright ban on the use of RBI with some arguing that the mass processing of biometric data from public spaces creates a serious risk of mass surveillance that infringes on fundamental rights.</p></li>
<li><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (EC 2021) is both a proposal for a regulatory framework on AI and a revised coordinated plan to support innovation. One feature of the act is the establishment of risk-dependent restrictions which would apply to the various uses of AI systems.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 6: Facial Recognition cameras at Brussels International Airport (Belgium)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Belgium is one of two European countries that has not yet authorised the use of FRT, however, law enforcement is strongly advocating for its use and the current legal obstacles to its implementation are unlikely to hold for very long.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2017, unbeknownst to the Belgian Supervisory Body for Police Information (COC), Brussels International Airport acquired 4 cameras connected to a facial recognition software for use by the airport police. Though the COC subsequently ruled that this use fell outside of the conditions for a lawful deployment, the legality of the airport experiment fell into a legal grey area because of the ways in which the technology was deployed.</p></li>
<li><p>One justification for the legality of the airport experiment from the General Commissioner of Federal Police was to compare the technological deployment to that of the legal use of other intelligent technologies such as Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). Although this argument was rejected at the time, such a system could be re-instated if the grounds for interruption are no long present in the law.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an emerging civil society movement in Belgium contesting the legitimacy of remote biometric identification. However, the amendments to the Police Act permitting<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the use of real-time smart cameras by the police in carrying out their administrative and judicial duties, and recent declarations of the Minister of Interior seems to point in the direction of more acceptance for remote biometric surveillance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 7: The Burglary Free Neighbourhood in Rotterdam (Netherlands)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Fieldlab Burglary Free Neighbourhood is a public-private collaboration with two aims: to detect suspicious behaviour and to influence the behaviour of the suspect. While the system of smart streetlamps does collect some image and sound-based data, it does not record any characteristics specific to the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>From a legal perspective, there is a question as to whether or not the data processed by the Burglary Free Neighbourhood programme qualifies as personal data and thus would fall within the scope of data protection legislation.</p></li>
<li><p>It is contested whether forms of digital monitoring and signalling are actually the most efficient methods for preventing break ins. Despite the aims of the programme, to date, the streetlights have only been used to capture data for the purposes of machine learning.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The infrastructure installed for the experiments can potentially be used for more invasive forms of monitoring. During the project, local police, for example, already voiced an interest in access to the cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>In March 2021, the Fieldlab trial ended. The data collected over the course of the project was not sufficient enough to have the computer distinguish suspicious trajectories. The infrastructure of cameras and microphones is currently disabled, yet remains in place.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 8: The Safe City Projects in Nice (France)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Several French cities have launched &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; projects involving biometric technologies, however Nice is arguably the national leader. The city currently has the highest CCTV coverage of any city in France and has more than double the police agents per capita of the neighbouring city of Marseille.</p></li>
<li><p>Through a series of public-private partnerships the city began a number of initiatives using RBI technologies (including emotion and facial recognition). These technologies were deployed for both authentication and surveillance purposes with some falling into the category of biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>One project which used FRT at <a>a high school in Nice</a> and <a>one in Marseille</a> was eventually declared unlawful. The court determined that the required consent could not be obtained due to the power imbalance between the targeted public (students) and the public authority (public educational establishment). This case highlights important issues about the deployment of biometric technologies in public spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of biometric mass surveillance by the mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi has put him on a collision course with the French Data Protection Authority (<a>CNIL</a>) as well as human rights/ digital rights organisations (Ligue des Droits de l&rsquo;Homme, <a>La Quadrature du Net</a>). His activities have raised both concern and criticism over the usage of the technologies and their potential impact on the privacy of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 9: Facial Recognition in S&uuml;dkreuz Berlin, Hamburg G20 and Mannheim (Germany)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The German federal police, in cooperation with the German railway company, conducted a project called &ldquo;Sicherheitsbahnhof&rdquo; at the Berlin railway station S&uuml;dkreuz in 2017/18, which included 77 video cameras and a video management system.</p></li>
<li><p>The police in Hamburg used facial recognition software <a>Videmo</a> 360 during the protests against the G20 summit in 2017. The database includes 100.000 individuals in Hamburg during the G20 summit and whose profiles are saved in the police database. The technology allows for the determination of behaviour, participation in gatherings, preferences, and religious or political engagement.</p></li>
<li><p>Sixty-eight cameras were installed by local police on central squares and places in the German city Mannheim to record the patterns of movement of people. In this project, which started in 2018, the software is used to detect conspicuous behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>Half of these deployments (Mannheim &amp; Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz) took place as measures to test the effectiveness of facial recognition and behavioural analysis software. This &ldquo;justification as a test&rdquo; approach is often used in Germany to argue for a deviation from existing rules and societal expectations and was similarly applied during deviations to commonly agreed measures in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.</p></li>
<li><p>Resistance to video surveillance is also in no small part a result of constant campaigning and protest by German civil society. The Chaos Computer Club and Digital Courage have consistently campaigned against video surveillance and any form of biometric or behavioural surveillance. The long-term effect of these &ldquo;pilots&rdquo; is to normalise surveillance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 10: The Dragonfly Project (Hungary)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Hungarian Government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n has long been on a collision course with EU Institutions over the rule of law and the undermining of the country&rsquo;s judicial independence and democratic institutions.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Hungary is a frontrunner in Europe when it comes to authorising law enforcement&rsquo;s use of Facial Recognition Technology, developing a nationwide and centralised database (The <a>Dragonfly Project</a>), and using the <a>Home Quarantine App</a> as part of the Government&rsquo;s Coronavirus measures.</p></li>
<li><p>The infrastructure in place that potentially allows for a centralised deployment of biometric mass surveillance technologies in Hungary has reached an unprecedented scale while the legal and ethical scrutiny of these technologies lags dangerously behind.</p></li>
<li><p>This is due to (1) the overlap between the private and public sectors, specifically government institutions, and (2) the complex entanglements biometric systems have with other information systems (such as car registries, traffic management, public transport monitoring and surveillance, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Although the latter are not concerned with the traces of the human body they can nonetheless be used for and facilitate biometric mass surveillance. These entanglements create grey zones of biometric mass surveillance where the development and deployment of such technologies is hidden from visibility and critical scrutiny.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a>Dragonfly Project</a> has elicited numerous warnings regarding data protection and the rights to privacy from both public and private organisations. However the lack of contestation and social debate around the issues of privacy and human rights in relation to such projects as the Hungarian Government&rsquo;s Dragonfly is striking.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 11: Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The EU should prohibit the deployment of both indiscriminate and &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; Remote Biometric and Behavioural Identification (RBI) technologies in public spaces (real-time RBI), as well as ex-post identification (or forensic RBI). Our analysis shows that both practices, even when used for &ldquo;targeted surveillance&rdquo; amount to mass surveillance.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>In line with similar recommendations made by the EDPB and the EDPS,<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn1" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> the EU should <strong>prohibit the deployment of Remote Biometric and Behavioural Identification technologies in public spaces</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>In line with the position of the EDRi regarding&rsquo;s EU Artificial Intelligence Act<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn2" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>, our research supports the notion that the <strong>distinction between "real-time&rdquo; and &ldquo;ex-post&rdquo; is irrelevant</strong> when it comes to the impact of these technologies on fundamental rights. Ex-post identification carries in fact a higher potential of harm, as more data can be pooled from different sources to proceed to the identification. The use of such technologies for <strong>&ldquo;targeted surveillance&rdquo; is thus equally harmful</strong> as the practice might be considered as expansive and intrusive to an extent that it would constitute disproportionate interference with the rights to privacy and personal data protection.</p></li>
  <li><p>This concerns not only the acquisition and processing of <strong>faces, but also gait, voice and other biometric or behavioural signals.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The EU should strengthen transparency and accountability of biometric and behavioural recognition technologies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our research found that the majority of surveillance systems remain <strong>opaque</strong>. There is very <strong>little information on how citizens' data is processed</strong> when they enter surveilled public spaces. Rarely are <strong>concrete alternatives</strong> provided if they do not wish to be surveilled. In some extreme cases, such as the deployment of FRT trials in London, citizens who deliberately avoided surveillance by covering their faces were <strong>subjected to fines</strong>. This poses considerable challenges to citizens&rsquo; rights, as well as to transparency and accountability of these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It seems thus necessary to expand existing transparency and accountability requirements</strong> in the new EU Artificial Intelligence Act for biometric technologies. These requirements should be expanded to include external independent accountability, transparency and oversight for any implementations of biometric technologies that are not already prohibited by the Act.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, it seems imperative to increase the transparency of such systems, by conditioning their operation to the publication of <strong>key characteristics and features</strong> (type of data acquisition, type of machine learning algorithm, nature of data collected in the database) necessary for <strong>effective public oversight</strong> of their operation. These details should be disclosed even when deployments are used for national security or law enforcement purposes, and the public should be informed about planned and ongoing projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The EU should promote the reinforcement of robust accountability mechanisms for biometric surveillance systems.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current legislative framework remains <strong>unclear</strong> as to which institutions may <strong>review or authorise biometric surveillance</strong> systems. In light of the GDPR and the LED, the Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in some member states enforce the relevant data protection legislation and oversee the processing of biometric data, while in others a separate authority is tasked with the responsibility to review the compatibility with the relevant legislation insofar as personal data processing by law enforcement authorities is concerned (such as Belgium, see case study).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU should work toward developing a <strong>centralised authorisation process for biometric surveillance</strong>, within which all relevant authorities are included and are able to veto the authorisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act limits a prior authorisation by a court or independent administrative authority to &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; biometric surveillance, it is necessary to underline that ex-post biometric identification systems must be subject to supervision or authorisation taking into account the standards under the ECHR and the Charter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. The EU should promote individual rights under the GDPR through the promotion of digital-rights-by-design technologies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>More attention could be given to protect <strong>individuals&rsquo; rights under GDPR</strong> when it comes to data collection and processing mechanisms as well as a <strong>fundamental rights assessment</strong> ex ante and <strong>ex post.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>This could be implemented technically through <strong>data minimisation or digital rights-by-design</strong> methods, either through <strong>technical solutions that do not collect biometric information</strong>, or systems which incorporate automated forms of <strong>notification</strong>, <strong>immutable</strong> <strong>transparency and accountability logging</strong>, and <strong>control of data</strong> or ideally by a combination of both approaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. The EU should ensure effective enforcement of GDPR purpose limitation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose limitation</strong> is one of the key principles of the GDPR. As our report shows, the <strong>re-purposing of biometric data</strong> is not always kept sufficiently in check.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>From a technical perspective, <strong>biometric mass surveillance can easily emerge by connecting different elements of a technical infrastructure</strong> (video acquisition capacities, processing algorithms, biometric datasets) <strong>developed in other contexts.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For example, while the <strong>forensic use of facial recognition</strong> is not a form of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> per se, the adoption of such systems has allowed for the creation of biometrically searchable national datasets. These datasets are one piece of a potential <strong>biometric mass surveillance</strong> infrastructure which can become a technical reality if live camera feeds, processed through live facial recognition software is connected to them.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to maintain democratic oversight over the uses of the infrastructure, and <strong>avoid the risk of function creep</strong> (i.e. when a technology is being used beyond its initial purpose) it is thus imperative that the principle of <strong>purpose limitation</strong> is systematically enforced and strictly regulated with regard to the <strong>type of data</strong> (criminal or civilian datasets, datasets generated from social media, as in the <a>Clearview AI</a> controversy) against which biometric searches can be performed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. The EU should support voices and organisations which are mobilised for the respect of EU fundamental rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finally, our research showed, in addition to state oversight agencies, many institutions from <strong>civil society</strong> are active in making sure that <strong>EU fundamental rights are respected</strong> in the field of biometric security technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>While in some countries they benefit from a <strong>dense network of civil society funding</strong>, in others they are subjected to <strong>heavy scrutiny and financial restrictions</strong> (see for example the Hungary case study in this report).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting civil society organisations</strong> that operate in the <strong>sector of digital rights</strong> is therefore instrumental for a healthy democratic debate and oversight. Civil society need to be able to participate in all relevant legislative and other decision-making procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Particularly in the area of <strong>litigation</strong>, support for civil society and EU citizens access to rights could be extremely helpful. We have found numerous areas in our study where sufficient legal clarity was lacking and would likely only take place through the courts. We would thus advise that the EU support existing <strong>digital rights litigation initiatives</strong> and create additional mechanisms to support this approach.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. The EU should take into account the global dimension of the Biometric and Behavioural Analysis Technology Industry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The technologies used for FRT in Europe come from <strong>vendors across the world</strong>. Technologies for biometric or behavioural analysis are often tested in one country before they are implemented in another.</p></li>
<li><p>EU policy on the biometric or behavioural analysis technology industry thus needs to consider its impact both <strong>inside and outside of Europe</strong>. Here, the recently revised <strong>EU Export Control framework</strong> which may include biometric and behavioural technologies can play a role.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The aim of this report is to establish a problematised overview of what is currently being done in Europe when it comes to remote biometric identification (RBI), and to assess in which cases we could potentially fall into forms of biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Private and public actors are increasingly deploying &ldquo;smart surveillance&rdquo; solutions including RBI technologies which, if left unchecked, could become biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Facial recognition technology has been the most discussed of the RBI technologies. However, there seems to be little understanding of the ways in which this technology might be applied and the potential impact of such a broad range of applications on the fundamental rights of European citizens.</p></li>
<li><p>The development of RBI systems by authoritarian regimes which may subsequently be exported to and used within Europe is of concern. Not only as it pertains to the deployments of such technologies but also the lack of adequate insight into the privacy practices of the companies supplying the systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Four main positions have emerged with regard to the deployments of RBI technologies and their potential impact on fundamental rights: 1) active promotion 2) support with safeguards; 3) moratorium and 4) outright ban.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>Since the widespread use of neural network algorithms in 2012, artificial intelligence applied to the field of security has steadily grown into a political, economic, and social reality. As examples from Singapore, the UK, South Africa, or China demonstrate, the image of a digital society of control, in which citizens are monitored through algorithmically processed audio and video feeds is becoming a tangible possible reality in the <a>European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Through a set of &ldquo;pilot projects&rdquo;, private and public actors including supermarkets, casinos, city councils, border guards, local and national law enforcement agencies are increasingly deploying a wide array of &ldquo;<strong>smart surveillance</strong>&rdquo; solutions. Among them <strong>remote biometric identification,</strong> namely <strong>security mechanisms &ldquo;that leverage unique biological characteristics&rdquo; such as fingerprints, facial images, iris or vascular patterns to &ldquo;identify multiple persons&rsquo; identities at a distance, in a public space and in a continuous or ongoing manner by checking them against data stored in a database.&rdquo;</strong> (European Commission 2020b, 18) European institutions have reacted with a series of policy initiatives in the last years, but as we will show in this report, if left unchecked, remote biometric identification technologies can easily become <strong>biometric mass surveillance</strong>.</p>

<p>Among technologies of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> has been at the centre of the attention of most discussions in the public debate. The foregrounding of this specific use case of computer vision in the public debate has allowed concerned actors to raise awareness on <strong>the dangers of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to biometric datasets</strong>. But it has also generated confusion. The perception that facial recognition is a single type of technology (i.e., an algorithm &ldquo;that recognises faces&rdquo;) has obscured <strong>the broad range of applications of &ldquo;smart technologies&rdquo; within very different bureaucratic contexts</strong>: from the &ldquo;smart cities&rdquo; live facial recognition of video feeds deployed for the purpose of public space surveillance, to the much more specific, on-the-spot searches by law enforcement for the purpose of carrying out arrests or forensic investigations.</p>

<p>The disentanglement and specification of each of these uses is important, if only because each distinct technological arrangement between sensing devices (cameras, microphones), datasets and algorithmic processing tools <strong>allows for radically different applications</strong>, and thus can have different types of <strong>impact on European citizens&rsquo; fundamental rights</strong>. As the recent communication of the European Commission (2021) stated, not all systems and not all applications are equally threatening for our democratic freedoms: some bear too much risk of infringing our fundamental rights &ndash; and therefore should never be allowed; some are &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; applications that can take place in certain circumstances with very clear safeguards; and some are more mundane uses of the technologies that require less attention. <strong>The ethical, political, and legal assessment of these levels of danger can therefore not be separated from a detailed understanding of how these technologies work.</strong> The limitation being of course that while we know what technologies are theoretically available to public actors, the detail of their <strong>characteristics is often hidden from view.</strong></p>
<section>
<h2>Objectives of the report</h2>
<p><strong>The aim of this report</strong> is thus to establish a problematised overview of <strong>what we know about</strong> what is currently being done in Europe when it comes to <strong>remote biometric identification</strong>, and to assess in which cases we could potentially fall into forms of <strong>biometric mass surveillance</strong>. The report will thus answer the following questions: What types of technologies are being used and how? In what context? By whom are these technologies used and to what aim? What types of actors are involved? What types of consequences does the use of those technologies entail? What legal basis and framework are applied to the use of those technologies? What are the forms of mobilisation and contestation against these uses?</p>

<p>In the rest of this introduction, we locate the political context for this study, including the voices that have called for a moratorium or a ban of all technologies that are associated with &ldquo;biometric mass surveillance&rdquo;. We then specify the objectives, scope, methodology, some working definitions and outline the remaining chapters.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The international context</h2>
<p>The concern for uncontrolled deployment of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> systems emerges in a context characterised by the development of technologies in authoritarian regimes; the development of controversial &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; projects as part of &ldquo;smart cities projects&rdquo; in Europe; revelations about controversial privacy practices of companies such as <a>Clearview AI</a>; and finally, by the structuration of a US and EU debate around some of the key biases and problems they entail.</p>

<p>In 2013, the Chinese authorities officially revealed the existence of a large system of mass surveillance involving more than 20 million cameras called Skynet, which had been established since 2005. While the cameras were aimed at the general public, more targeted systems were deployed in provinces such as Tibet and Xinjiang where political groups contest the authority of Beijing. In 2018, the surveillance system became coupled with a <strong>system of social credit</strong>, and Skynet became increasingly connected to facial recognition technology (Ma 2018; Jiaquan 2018). By 2019, it was estimated that Skynet had reached 200 million face-recognition enabled CCTV cameras (Mozur 2018).</p>

<p>The intrusiveness of the system, and its impact on fundamental rights is best exemplified by its deployment in the Xinjiang province. The province capital, Urumqi, is chequered with <strong>checkpoints and identification stations</strong>. Citizens need to submit to facial recognition ID checks in supermarkets, hotels, train stations, highway stations and several other public spaces (Chin and B&uuml;rge 2017). The information collected through the cameras is centralised and matched against other <strong>biometric data</strong> such as <strong>DNA samples</strong> and <strong>voice samples</strong>. This allows the government to attribute <strong>trust-worthiness scores</strong> (trustworthy, average, untrustworthy) and thus generate a list of individuals that can become candidates for detention (Wang 2018).</p>

<p>European countries&rsquo; deployments are far from the Chinese experience. But the companies involved in China&rsquo;s pervasive digital surveillance network (such as <strong>Tencent</strong>, <strong><a>Dahua Technology</a></strong>, <strong><a>Hikvision</a></strong>, <strong>SenseTime</strong>, <strong>ByteDance</strong> and <strong><a>Huawei</a></strong>) are exporting their know-how to Europe, under the form of &ldquo;<strong>safe city&rdquo; packages</strong>. <strong><a>Huawei</a></strong> is one of the most active in this regard. On the European continent, the city of Belgrade has for example deployed an extensive communication network of more than 1.000 cameras which collect up to 10 body and facial attributes (Stojkovski 2019). The cameras, deployed on poles, major traffic crossings and a large number of public spaces allow the Belgrade police to monitor large parts of the city centre, collect <strong>biometric information</strong> and communicate it directly to police officers deployed in the field. Belgrade has the most advanced deployment of <a>Huawei</a>&rsquo;s surveillance technologies on the European continent, but similar projects are being implemented by other corporations &ndash; including the <strong>European companies <a>Thales</a>, <a>Engie Ineo</a> or <a>Idemia</a></strong> &ndash; in other European cities and many &ldquo;Safe City&rdquo; deployments are planned soon in EU countries such as France, Italy, Spain, <a>Malta</a>, and Germany (Hillman and McCalpin 2019). Furthermore, contrary to the idea China would be the sole exporter of Remote Biometric Identification technologies, EU companies have substantially developed their exports in this domain over the last years (Wagner 2021)</p>
<p>The turning point of public debates on facial recognition in Europe was probably <strong>the <a>Clearview AI</a> controversy</strong> in 2019-2020. <strong><a>Clearview AI</a></strong>, a company founded by Hoan Ton-That and Richard Schwartz in the United States, maintained a relatively secret profile until a New York Times article revealed in late 2019 that it was selling <strong>facial recognition technology</strong> to law enforcement.&nbsp; In February 2020, it was reported that the client list of <a>Clearview AI</a> had been stolen, and a few days later the details of the list were leaked (Mac, Haskins, and McDonald 2020). To the surprise of many in Europe, in addition to US government agencies and corporations, it appeared that the Metropolitan Police Service (London, UK), as well as <strong>law enforcement from Belgian, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, <a>Italy</a>, Latvia, Lithuania, <a>Malta</a>, the <a>Netherlands</a>, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, <a>Slovenia</a>, Spain, <a>Sweden</a>, and Switzerland were on the client list.</strong> The controversy grew larger as it emerged that <a>Clearview AI</a> had (semi-illegally) harvested a large number of images from social media platforms such as <strong><a>Facebook</a>, YouTube</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> in order to constitute the datasets against which clients were invited to carry out searches (Mac, Haskins, and McDonald 2020).</p>

<p>The news of the hacking strengthened a strong push-back movement against the development of facial recognition technology by companies such as <a>Clearview AI</a>, as well as their use by government agencies. In 2018, <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong> (MIT) scholar and <strong><a>Algorithmic Justice League</a></strong> founder <strong>Joy Buolamwini</strong> together with <strong>Temnit Gebru</strong> had published the report <em>Gender Shades</em> (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018), in which they assessed the racial bias in the face recognition datasets and algorithms used by companies such as <a>IBM</a> and Microsoft. Buolamwini and Gebru found that <strong>algorithms performed generally worse on darker-skinned faces, and in particular darker-skinned females, with error rates up to 34% higher than lighter-skinned males</strong> (Najibi 2020). <a>IBM</a> and Microsoft responded by amending their systems, and a re-audit showed less bias. Not all companies responded equally. <strong>Amazon&rsquo;s Rekognition</strong> system, which was included in the second study continued to show a 31% lower rate for darker-skinned females. The same year <strong>ACLU</strong> conducted another key study on Amazon&rsquo;s Rekognition, using the pictures of <strong>members of congress against a dataset of mugshots from law enforcement</strong>. 28 members of Congress, <strong>largely people of colour were incorrectly matched</strong> (Snow 2018). A number of organizations seized the problem as a policy issue (<strong><a>Black in AI</a></strong>, <strong><a>Algorithmic Justice League</a>, <a>Data for Black Lives</a></strong>) and some engaged lawmakers. In 2019, the Algorithmic Accountability Act allowed the Federal Trade Commission to regulate private companies&rsquo; uses of facial recognition. In 2020, several companies, including <a>IBM</a>, Microsoft, and Amazon, announced a moratorium on the development of their facial recognition technologies. Several US cities, including <strong>Boston</strong>, <strong>Cambridge</strong> (Massachusetts) <strong>San Francisco</strong>, <strong>Berkeley</strong>, <strong>Portland</strong> (Oregon), have also banned their police forces from using the technology.</p>

<h2>The European context</h2>
<p>In Europe, a similar set of developments took place around Artificial Intelligence in activist circles, both at the member states level and at the EU level. (Andra&scaron;ko et al. 2021, 3). The first intervention dates from 2017 with the <strong>European Parliament</strong> <em>Resolution of 16 February to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics</em> (European Parliament 2017). It was followed by two statements and advisory documents: <em>The Age of Artificial Intelligence</em>, published by the European Political Strategy Centre; and a <em>Statement on Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em>Robotics and Autonomous Systems</em> (March 2018), published by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (Andra&scaron;ko et al. 2021, 3). At the beginning of 2018, the <strong>European Economic and Social Committee</strong> issued three opinions on the deployment of AI in practice (European Economic and Social Committee 2018a, 2018b, 2018c). All these documents addressed <strong>the need for the EU to understand AI uses</strong>, and embedded them in the various ethical and political frameworks created by EU institutions. The same year, the <strong>Council of Europe</strong> began its activities on the matter. In 2017, the <strong>Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</strong> adopted a <em>Recommendation on Technological Convergence, Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights</em> pointing towards the need to established common guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence in court (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 2017; Gonzalez Fuster 2020, 45).</p>

<p>Legislative activity accelerated in 2018. The <strong>European Commission</strong> (2018a) published a communication <em>Artificial Intelligence for Europe</em>, in which it called for a joint legal framework for the regulation of AI-related services. Later in the year, the Commission (2018b) adopted a <em>Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence</em> with similar objectives. It compelled EU member states to adopt a national strategy on artificial intelligence which should meet the EU requirements. It also allocated 20 billion euros each year for investment in AI development. (Andra&scaron;ko et al. 2021, 4).</p>

<p>In 2019, the <strong>Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights</strong> published a Recommendation entitled <em>Unboxing Artificial Intelligence: 10 steps to Protect Human Rights</em> which describes several steps for national authorities to maximise the potential of AI while preventing or mitigating the risk of its misuse. (Gonzalez Fuster 2020, 46). The same year the <strong><a>European Union</a>&rsquo;s <a>High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI HLEG)</strong> adopted the <em>Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</em>, a key document for the EU strategy in bringing AI within ethical standards (Nesterova 2020, 3).</p>

<p>In February 2020, the new <strong>European Commission</strong> went one step further in regulating matters related to AI, adopting the digital agenda package &ndash; a set of documents outlining the strategy of the EU in the digital age. Among the documents the <em>White Paper on Artificial Intelligence: a European approach to excellence and trust</em> captured most of the commission&rsquo;s intentions and plans. &nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Four positions in the policy debates</h2>
<p>Over the past 3-4 years, positions around the use of facial recognition and more specifically the use of remote biometric identification in public space have progressively crystalised into four camps (for a more detailed analysis of the positions, see Chapter 5).</p>
<section>
<h3>Active promotion</h3>
<p>A certain number of actors, both at the national and at the local level are pushing for the development and the extension of biometric remote identification. At the local level, figures such as Nice&rsquo;s (France) mayor Christian Estrosi have repeatedly challenged Data Protection Authorities, arguing for the usefulness of such technologies in the face of insecurity (for a detailed analysis, see chapter 8 in this report, see also Barelli 2018). <strong>At the national level, Biometric systems for the purposes of authentication are increasingly deployed for forensic applications</strong> among law-enforcement agencies in the <a>European Union</a>. As we elaborate in Chapter 3, 11 out of 27 member states of the <a>European Union</a> are already using facial recognition against biometric databases for forensic purposes and 7 additional countries are expected to acquire such capabilities in the near future. Several states that have not yet adopted such technologies seem inclined to follow the trend, and push further. Former Belgian Minister of Interior Pieter De Crem for example, recently declared he was in favour of the use of facial recognition both for judicial inquiries but also for live facial recognition, a much rarer instance. Such outspoken advocates of the use of RBI constitute an important voice, but do not find an echo in the EU mainstream discussions.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Support with safeguards </h3>
<p>While there is little widespread support for the development of centralised biometric mass surveillance, some actors such as the <strong>European Council</strong> and the <strong>European Commission</strong> have advocated a cautious and regulated development of remote biometric identification systems, as part of a broader Artificial Intelligence strategy. The principles of such strategies have been outlined in the various strategy documents discussed above. A large number of the technology companies are hoping that this position remains the main one, with many of them eager to implement the ethical requirements necessary for the deployments of their systems. <strong>In addition to the political and legislative activity mentioned above, the EU institutions have been active in promoting the use of Artificial Intelligence and biometric surveillance technologies. As detailed in chapter 5, instruments such as the Digital Europe programme, the Connecting Europe Facility 2 and Horizon Europe will form the basis for collaboration between public institutions and the security industry developing biometric remote identification products. In the European Parliament, positions are divided and moving, but parties like the European People Party support a similar notion of careful development.</strong></p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Moratorium</h3>
<p>For other actors, such as the <strong>European Parliament</strong> or the Council of Europe, remote biometric identification systems entail too many unknown risks and thus need to be put on hold. The proponents of a moratorium invoke the necessity of applying the <em>principle of precaution</em> &ndash; a similar strategy to opponents of the commercialisation of GMO in Europe &ndash; so that all dimensions of the technology can be assessed before a decision can be made. On 20 January 2021, &nbsp;the <strong>European Parliament</strong> passed a resolution inviting the EU Commission to consider a moratorium on the use of facial recognition systems (European Parliament 2021). Similarly, in 2021, the Council of Europe (2021) adopted <strong>Guidelines on Facial Recognition</strong> (Council of Europe, 2021) which call for a <strong>moratorium for the live facial recognition technologies</strong> and lay out certain conditions for the use of facial recognition technologies by law enforcement authorities.)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Ban</h3>
<p>Finally, a growing number of actors considers that there is enough information about remote biometric identification in public space to determine that they will never be able to comply to the strict requirement of the <a>European Union</a> in terms of respect of Fundamental Rights, and as such should be banned entirely. It is the current position of the <strong>European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS, 2021)</strong> the <strong>Council of Europe</strong> and a large coalition of NGOs (among which <strong><a>La Quadrature du Net</a></strong> and the collaborative project <strong>Technopolice</strong>,) gathered under the umbrella of the <strong><a>European Digital Rights organisation</a></strong> (EDRi 2020). In the <strong>European Parliament</strong>, the position has most vocally been defended by the European Greens, but has been shared by several other voices, such as members of the Party of the European Left, the Party of European Socialists or Renew Europe (Breyer et al 2021).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Lack of transparency and the stifling of public debate</h2>
<p>An additional important question concerns the reaction of the public at large. While the development of face recognition technologies and more broadly remote biometric identification systems has elicited stark responses from watchdogs, civil liberties unions and human rights activist (CNIL 2019b; EDRi 2020; Renaissance Num&eacute;rique 2019; Gonzales Fuster 2020), the state of the debate and awareness in the wider public is actively muddled by a lack of transparency in how these technologies are developed and implemented, both by private companies and public authorities.</p>
<p>This lack of transparency, and sometimes secrecy surrounding some of the technological parameters is not casual: &ldquo;vendors of facial recognition software might not want to disclose information about the training data, as was experienced by an expert from a civil society organization&rdquo; warns the FRA (2019, 10). Copyright issues and trade secrets are invoked to also block access to information that would be needed to assess the quality of systems employed. Governments, at the national or local level, invoke national security concerns in order to remain opaque about the deployment of the technologies, the contracted parties (See Chapter 10) and citizens often found out about their implementation after the fact (see Chapter 6). Finally, the societal debate about these issues is further hindered by the porosity between the public and private dimensions of these technologies. Users often willingly volunteer their biometric data, and do not always perceive the technical differences that might exist between unlocking their phones through facial recognition (the data remains in a separate chip on the phone) and using applications which leak biometric information in remote databases, making them available not only to commercial vendors, governments, law enforcements authorities, but hackers and other actors interested in the misuse of this data.</p>
<p>For these reasons, <strong>informed political debate cannot take place without a thorough effort of digital literacy concerning the development of these new technologies.</strong> But it will also rely on information being made available to the public, so that the parties involved can be held accountable and the impact of technologies on the everyday life of European citizens can be critically assessed. The aim of this report is thus precisely to present evidence about the remote biometric identification technologies, the current state of their deployment in Europe as well as their ethical, social, and political implications to provide context and recommendation on the various positions.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Scope and working definitions</h2>
<p>This report will be centred on &ldquo;biometric and behavioural mass surveillance&rdquo; in public spaces. In addition to the definition of Remote Biometric Identification provided above, we define <strong>biometric data</strong> as all data related to the body, which can be used to identify or monitor individuals or groups of individuals and is impossible or very difficult to alter (face, fingerprints, iris, etc.). <strong>Behavioural data</strong> concerns the data collected related to the way in which individuals uniquely behave (facial expressions, body movements, voice, etc.). Finally, we define <strong>Biometric Mass Surveillance</strong> as a form of <strong>monitoring, tracking, or processing of personal (biometric and behavioural) data of individuals indiscriminately and in a generalised manner without a prior criminal suspicion (FRA, 2019</strong>). We can add that this surveillance occurs <strong>at a distance, in a public space and in a continuous or ongoing manner by checking them against data stored in a database.</strong> We thus conceptualise biometric mass surveillance, if left unchecked, as the <strong>possible dystopian horizon</strong> of <strong>remote biometric identification technologies.</strong></p>
<p>The report will primarily focus on those technologies (<strong>facial recognition</strong>, <strong>voice recognition</strong>, and the <strong>classification of behaviour</strong>) that are deployed in EU public spaces. It will initially focus on the deployment of such technologies by public actors in <strong>public spaces in the EU</strong>, such as cities. Public spaces can be <strong>publicly owned</strong> (roads, streets, city squares, parking facilities, government facilities) or <strong>privately owned</strong> (shopping malls, stadiums). Similarly, private actors can deploy these technologies <strong>in public spaces in collaboration with, or for further use by, public actors</strong> (e.g., the use of private Amazon Ring footage collected by individuals and shared with the police in some US cities).</p>
<p>On the basis of these specifications, the following cases are being excluded from the analysis: deployment of remote biometric identification technologies by private actors in private spaces (one&rsquo;s house) if such deployments have no public consequences; deployment of remote biometric identification technologies created by EU companies used outside of the EU (exports); deployment of remote biometric identification outside of EU public spaces (such as surveillance of the EU borders in the Mediterranean). Further technical definitions are provided in CHAPTER 2.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>This report is based primarily on desk research. It is based on primary sources from international and regional organisations, national governments, local authorities, non-governmental organizations and private companies, as well as secondary sources (academic literature). For some of the case studies qualitative interviews were carried out remotely (via telephone or video-call) and are indicated as such. For the dataset used in the related interactive map, we are particularly grateful to the Technopolice project and to Felix Tr&eacute;guer for helping us accessing the data already collected for France. The report was commissioned in February 2021 and was written between February 2021 and October 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current market of RBI systems is overwhelmingly dominated by image-based products, at the centre of which is facial recognition technology (FRT). Other products such as face detection and person detection technologies are also in use.</p></li>
<li><p>FRT is typically being deployed to perform two types of searches: cooperative searches for verification and/ or authentication purposes, and non-cooperative searches to identify a data subject. The former involves voluntary consent from the data subject to capture their image, while the latter may not.</p></li>
<li><p>Live facial recognition is currently the most controversial deployment of FRT: Live video feeds are used to generate snapshots of individuals and then match them against a database of known individuals &ndash; the &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Other RBI technologies are being deployed though their use at present is marginal compared to FRT, these include gait, audio, and emotion recognition technologies, amongst others.</p></li>
<li><p>A better understanding of the technical components and possible usage applications of image-based RBI technologies is needed in order to assess their potential political implications.</p></li>
<li><p>RBI technologies are subject to technical challenges and limitations which should be considered in any broader analysis of their ethical, legal, and political implications.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>In order to grasp the various facets of remote biometric identification that could potentially lead to biometric mass surveillance, this section provides an overview of the currently available technologies, how they work and what their limitations are as well as where and by whom they are deployed in the <a>European Union</a>.</p>
<section>
<h2>Remote Biometric Identification and classification: defining key terms</h2>
<p>Although there are a growing number of technologies based on other supports than images (photographs or videos) such as voice recognition (audio), LIDAR scans or radio waves, the current market of remote biometric identification is overwhelmingly dominated by image-based products, at the centre of which is face recognition. In the following sections we thus focus primarily on image-based products.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2><strong>D</strong>etection vs <strong>r</strong>ecognition</h2>
<p><strong>- Person detection</strong> denotes the ability of a software application to estimate (as in, provide a statistical probability) whether an object in the camera image is a person. Generally, it is able to indicate the position of the person in the image. Person detection systems can be used in <strong>basic analytics scenarios</strong>, where for example the presence of people is counted. Moreover, object detection algorithms can be used to track individuals between video frames, although they generally have a hard time tracking occlusions (people walking in front of others, hiding them from the camera) and specific people across multiple camera viewpoints. Person detection does not obtain any information about individuals faces.</p>
<p><strong>- Face detection</strong>, similar to person detection, refers to the capacity of a software application to detect that an object in the field of view of a camera is a human face. It is the most familiar function of smart technologies: it has been present in consumer electronics, such as photo cameras and mobile phones for years. Face detection provides the recognisable rectangle around faces when taking a picture with a smart phone. Similarly, it can be used in surveillance applications to assess the presence or positions of individuals.</p>
<p>- <strong>Facial recognition</strong> builds on top of face detection. The software uses the detected faces to determine who is in the picture. In order to do so, an algorithm calculates a numerical representation of the detected face, called a &ldquo;feature vector&rdquo; or &ldquo;embedding&rdquo;. This vector, which is unique to each individual, is what allows systems to perform searches. The detected vector can for example be used to search for existing identical vectors in a database of known individuals, where vectors are related to an identity. In a different type of usage, the feature vector can be used to track people moving from one camera&rsquo;s field of view to the next. In this case, the vector is not used to find a &ldquo;match&rdquo; in a database but serves instead to confirm that it is the same individual that appears in different camera feeds.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Facial Recognition: verification/authentication vs identification </h2>
<p>Within the domain of facial recognition, two general types of searches are performed.</p>
<p>- <strong>One-to-one (1:1) searches</strong> are called <strong>verification or authentication</strong> searches and are used to determine whether an individual face presented to the camera matches a single face stored in the system. This is how &ldquo;Face ID&rdquo; works on iPhones for example. In this example, people volunteer the capture of their face, they are thus considered in a &ldquo;<strong>cooperative&rdquo; scenario</strong>.</p>
<p>- <strong>One-to-many (1:N) searches</strong> are called <strong>identification</strong> searches. An unknown single face, picked up for example from surveillance video footage or from a passport, is run against a large dataset of known faces, in order to identify the unknown face, or to determine if it occurs on a so called &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo;. This can be done in the case of forensic investigations or can be deployed in remote biometric identification scenarios in the public space. In this latter example, when faces are captured without the intention or consent of the individuals, the capture is considered &ldquo;<strong>non-cooperative</strong>&rdquo;. Because of the larger amount of data, identification is from a technical perspective, substantially more difficult to perform than authentication. As such, many of these implementations do not return a single identity upon request, but rather provide a list of likely identities with, for example, a match likeliness score. Note that <strong>identification does not automatically entail the recoding of the name of the individual in the database</strong>. For example, if visitors of a shop are recorded, the software can look for recurring visitors without having their names.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Forensic (ex-post) vs Live Facial Recognition</h2>
<p>A final distinction can be made between forensic (or ex-post) and live facial recognition. <strong>Forensic facial</strong> recognition is carried out generally in the context of judicial investigations in order to match photographs of persons of interest captured via surveillance cameras or extracted from documents to an operational database of known individuals (Al-Kawaz et al. 2018). It is the most commonly use type of facial recognition in Europe, in particular by law enforcement authorities. <strong>Live facial recognition,</strong> instead, uses live video feeds in order to generate snapshots of individuals and then match them against a database of known individuals &ndash; the &ldquo;watchlist&rdquo;. It is the most controversial deployment of facial recognition (Fussey and Murray 2019).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Other systems: gait recognition, emotion recognition</h2>
<p>Facial recognition occupies the central stage of the discussion when it comes to remote biometric identification and classification, because it is simply the most mature technology. Yet other technologies should be mentioned, in particular when considering biometric classification. They are for the moment relatively marginal, and information about their deployment is anecdotal at this stage.</p>
<section>
<h3>Gait recognition </h3>
<p><strong>Gait recognition</strong> consists of recognising the specific way in which a person walks (gait), but in reality it covers a broader range of criteria (body, proportions, posture, etc.) (Segal 2020, 2). The advantages of gait recognition are that it does not require a clear access to a face, and it requires a lower image resolution (as it analyses an entire body, not only a face). Gait recognition, however, requires <strong>more computing power</strong> because it works on the basis of moving images (i.e., multiple frames of still images, up to 30 frames per second) rather than still images. Gait recognition has been used as evidence in court for a case in Denmark (Segal 2020, 18). Gait recognition poses important technical challenges: The amount of data storage and processing power far exceeds that of facial recognition. There are currently very few training datasets. So far, systems have proven to be more expensive, and less accurate than facial recognition.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>People tracking and counting </h3>
<p>This is perhaps the form of person tracking with which the least information about an individual is stored. An <strong>object detection algorithm</strong> estimates the presence and position of individuals on a camera image. These positions are stored or counted and used for further metrics. It is used to count <strong>passers-by in city centres</strong>, and for a <strong>one-and-a-half-meter social distancing monitor in Amsterdam</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn3" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>. See also the case study in this document on the <a>Burglary-Free Neighbourhood</a> in Rotterdam (CHAPTER 7), which goes into more detail about the use of the recorded trajectories of individuals to label anomalous behaviour.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Emotion recognition. </h3>
<p>Software that categorises facial expressions into emotion categories &ndash; happiness, sadness, anger, etc. &ndash; is known to be used in billboards that are equipped with cameras, in order to <strong>analyse audience response to advertisements</strong>. For example, in airports or at train stations. While the face is claimed to be a &ldquo;window into the brain&rdquo; by some, the technology has been heavily criticised. Firstly, some consider it an undesirable invasion of their privacy, while other critique the technology for capturing primarily stereotypical ways of expressing oneself (van de Ven, 2017). In some places, such as at Dutch train stations, these critiques have led to disabling the cameras in billboards altogether (Het Parool, 2017).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Age, gender, and ethnicity classification </h3>
<p>Aside from deducing emotions, the face is used to deduce a variety of traits from individuals. For example, <strong>gender</strong>, <strong>ethnicity</strong>, and <strong>age estimations</strong> are available in many off-the-shelf facial analysis products. As with <strong>emotion recognition</strong>, these classifications are mainly used in digital signage and video advertisement contexts. LGBTQ+ communities have spoken out against automatic gender classification, pointing out that a long fought, non-binary understanding of gender is made undone by the technology&rsquo;s binary classifications (Vincent, 2021). Similarly, recent revelations that <a>Hikvision</a> (China) has used similar technology to estimate whether an individual is from <strong>China&rsquo;s Uyghur minority</strong>, has directly led the <strong>European Parliament</strong> to call for a ban of <strong><a>Hikvision</a>&rsquo;s</strong> products on the Parliament&rsquo;s premises (Rollet, 2021).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Audio recognition </h3>
<p>From a technological perspective, neural networks process audio relatively similarly to how video is processed: rather than feeding an image, a spectrogram is used as input for the network. However, under the GDPR, recording conversations, is illegal in the <a>European Union</a> without informed consent of the participants. In order to adhere to these regulations, on some occasions, only particular frequencies are recorded and processed. For example, in the <strong><a>Burglary-Free Neighbourhood</a> in Rotterdam (Netherlands)</strong> (CHAPTER 7), only two frequencies are used to classify audio; making conversations indiscernible while being able to discern shouting or the breaking of glass<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn4" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>. Another initiative using audio in to enhance the surveillance camera is the <strong>Living Lab International Zone</strong> project in the Hague (Netherlands), a collaboration between a broad range of partners<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn5" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<section>
<h2>How does image-based remote biometric identification work?</h2>
<p>In order to assess the political implication of each of these systems, it is important to disaggregate the main technical components and understand the different possible technologies at play. Although the marketing of security companies uses the notion of &ldquo;smart cameras&rdquo;, one should distinguish between the sensing hardware (cameras, microphones, LIDAR scanners) and the type of video analytics the captured data is subjected to. This second aspect should be further divided into an analysis of the training datasets and the algorithms.</p>
<section>
<h3>Image acquisition: Controlled and uncontrolled images</h3>
<p>Facial recognition begins with an image. An image which will be subject to the algorithm&rsquo;s scrutiny. <strong>Controlled images</strong> are images that are captured for the purpose of processing, aimed at optimal positions and lighting conditions. They are for example taken at a police station, or at a photographer&rsquo;s studio with strict requirements, and are either contained in databases that precede the introduction of a facial recognition system (e.g., driver&rsquo;s license databases) or are specifically designed to match high criteria of biometric systems (i.e., photographs for biometric passports). <strong>Uncontrolled images</strong> are images that are captured outside of specific requirement, collected for example through social media scraping or video surveillance.</p>
<p>When it comes to the acquisition technologies (cameras) for uncontrolled images, over the past decades, the main evolution in terms of video has been the passage from analogue video to digital video, the latter allowing images to be processed through computers. As in the realm of consumer cameras, the initial race was for better definition (calculated in terms of megapixels). &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; camera systems require a slightly higher resolution than standard video surveillance systems in order to guarantee a minimum of 300 PPM to adequately feed the software (IPVM Team 2020, 5). But overall, the average camera does not exceed a definition of 4 megapixels and are more often in the area of 2 megapixels (which yields a 1080p or HD resolution)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn6" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a>. <strong>The quality of capture</strong>, especially in non-cooperative scenarios, is determined by two main external variables: the angle of the face relative to the camera (front, side, back, top) and the lighting conditions (bright daylight, dark night). In recent years, manufacturers have added an additional infra-red channel to the red-green-blue (RGB) video channels in order to increase detail accuracy in low-light conditions.</p>

<h3>What makes systems &ldquo;smart&rdquo;: image processing algorithms</h3>
<p>The processing of the photographic or video image by a specific software application is where the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; processing happens. Broadly speaking video surveillance technology can be split in two key historical moments: before machine learning, and after machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Video motion detection (VMD) and heuristic filters.</strong> The early smart technologies relied on simple motion detection algorithms which compared pixel changes from one image to the next (Quevillon 2012). The problem is that any movement (the leaves of a tree) or change of light (a car passing in the night) can trigger the systems. <strong>Heuristic filters</strong> were thus added to VMD systems in order to give additional parameters to the system (amount and size of pixel changing etc.). Both systems were highly inefficient and prone to trigger false alarms, making such technologies unattractive. The main problem was that only pre-established changes hard coded by humans would be detected by the systems.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning.</strong> Machine learning revolutionised image-based biometric identification. Machine learning is an automated process through which the software application will be programmed to recognise particular patterns, based on a dataset it is &ldquo;trained&rdquo; on. There are three ways in which this configuration of the machine learning model can be controlled: supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. <strong>Supervised machine learning</strong> consists of teaching the system to recognise people, cars, guns, or any other object by feeding it an annotated dataset of such objects. It is supervised because humans &ldquo;supervise&rdquo; how the computer learns, by annotating the dataset (&ldquo;this is a car&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is a gun&rdquo; etc.). The categories of the annotations (cars, guns, etc.) will thus be the only ones that the system will be able to recognise (if only cars and guns are annotated, the system won&rsquo;t in such a case recognise cats). Most video surveillance systems use supervised machine learning (IPVM Team 2021a, 11)<strong>. Unsupervised machine learning</strong> lets the system cluster objects by itself. The advantage is the open-endedness of the systems (meaning they can generate categories of objects not anticipated in the training dataset), but the disadvantage is that algorithms can potentially cluster objects along irrelevant criteria for the task (for example clustering red motorcycles, cars, and trucks in one group and green ones in another, as opposed to creating one cluster for all motorcycles, one for cars and one for trucks). For this reason, <strong>semi-supervised machine learning</strong>, where only a small part of the data is labelled, can be used. Currently not widely in use, unsupervised machine learning is a growing trend in the video surveillance sector (IPVM Team 2021a, 12&ndash;13).</p>
<p>Both supervised and unsupervised learning exist in many shapes and sizes. For example, the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn7" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a> from 2001, which made real-time face detection viable, is a supervised algorithm. Contemporary developments in video processing focus on using various kinds of artificial <strong>neural networks</strong> (i.e., <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong>, <strong>recurrent neural networks</strong>) to classify images and videos. These networks can be trained either <strong>supervised</strong>, <strong>semi-supervised</strong> or <strong>unsupervised</strong> depending on their configuration.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3><strong>Machine learning</strong> and operational datasets</h3>
<p>Remote biometric identification and classification relies in large part on datasets, for two key but distinct moments of their operation.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning datasets.</strong> These are the datasets used to train models through <strong>machine learning.</strong> We find three categories of such datasets. <strong>Publicly available datasets</strong> for object detection such as COCO, ImageNet, Pascal VOC include a varying number of images labelled in a range of categories, these can be used to train algorithms to detect for example people on an image (IPVM Team 2021a, 27). The most used open-source datasets for surveillance technologies are Celeb 500k, MS-Celeb-1Million-Cleaned, Labeled Faces in the Wild, VGG Face 2, DeepGlint Asian Celeb, IMDB-Face, IMDB-Wiki, CelebA, Diveface, Flickr faces and the IARPA Janus Benchmark (IPVM Team 2021b, 7). Many of these datasets also function as a public benchmark, against which the performance and accuracy of various algorithms is measured. For example, Labeled Faces in the Wild, the COCO dataset and <a>NIST</a> present such leaderboards on their website<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn8" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a>. <strong>Government datasets</strong> are generally collections of images available to a government for other purposes (driver&rsquo;s license, passport, or criminal record photo datasets). While in Europe most of these datasets are not accessible to the public, in China and in the US, they are made available for testing and training purposes to private companies, such as the Multiple Encounter Dataset (NIST, 2010). Finally <strong>proprietary datasets</strong> may be developed by providers for their specific applications.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning models.</strong> In the machine learning process, an algorithm gets iteratively configured for the optimal output, based on the particular dataset that it is fed with. This can be a neural network, but also e.g., the aforementioned Viola-Jones&rsquo; object detector algorithm. The <strong>model</strong> is the final configuration of this learning process. As such, it does not contain the images of the dataset in and of themselves. Rather, it represents the abstractions the algorithm &ldquo;learned&rdquo; over time. In other words, the model operationalises the machine learning dataset. For example, the YOLO object detection algorithm yields different results when it is trained on either the COCO or the model (in conjunction with the algorithm) which determines the translation of an image into a category, or of the image of a face into its embedding.</p>
<p><strong>Operational datasets, or image databases.</strong> Datasets used in training machine learning models should be distinguished from matching or operational datasets which are the &ldquo;watchlists&rdquo; of for example criminals, persons of interest or other lists of individuals against which facial recognition searches will be performed &ndash; whether these are in real time or post hoc. These datasets contain pre-processed images of individuals on the watchlist, and store the numerical representations of these faces, their feature vectors or <em>embedding</em>, in an index for fast retrieval and comparison with the queried features (using for example k-Nearest Neighbour or Support Vector Machines). Face or object detection models do not use such a dataset.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>Facial recognition algorithms can be developed in-house, taken from an open-source repository, or purchased (IPVM Team 2021b, 14). Popular <strong>open-source facial recognition</strong> implementations include OpenCV, Face_pytorch, OpenFace and Insightface. Many of these software libraries are developed at universities or implement algorithms and neural network architectures presented in academic papers. They are free, and allow for a great detail of customisation, but require substantial programming skills to be implemented in a surveillance system. Moreover, when using such software, the algorithms run on one&rsquo;s own hardware which provides the developer with more control, but also requires more maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary facial recognition.</strong> There are three possible routes for the use of proprietary systems: There are <strong>&ldquo;turnkey&rdquo;</strong> systems sold by manufacturers such as <strong><a>Hikvision</a></strong>, <strong><a>Dahua</a></strong>, <strong><a>AnyVision</a></strong> or <strong><a>Briefcam</a></strong>. Those integrate the software and hardware, and as such can be directly deployed by the client. <strong>Algorithm developers</strong> such as <strong>Amazon AWS Rekognition</strong> (USA), <strong><a>NEC</a></strong> (Japan), <strong><a>NTechlab</a></strong> (Russia), <strong><a>Paravision</a></strong> (USA) allow to implement their algorithms and customise them to one&rsquo;s needs, and finally there are <strong>&ldquo;cloud&rdquo; API systems</strong>, a sub-set of the former category, where the algorithm is hosted in a datacentre and is accessed remotely (IPVM Team 2021b, 16). The latter type of technology bears important legal ramifications, as the data may travel outside of national or European jurisdictions. It should be noted that many of the proprietary products are based on similar algorithms and network architectures as their open-source counterparts (OpenCV, 2021). Contrary to the open-source software, it is generally unclear which datasets of images have been used to train the proprietary algorithms.</p>

<h2>Technical limits, problems, and challenges of facial recognition</h2>
<p>Contrary to what can often be read in dystopian accounts of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> technologies, these systems are neither &ldquo;entirely inefficient&rdquo;, nor &ldquo;all powerful&rdquo;. They are subjected to technical challenges and limitations, which should be considered in the broader analysis of their <strong>ethical, legal, and political implications</strong>.</p>
<section>
<h3>Data capture challenges</h3>
<p>Facial recognition&rsquo;s accuracy can easily be challenged by a certain number of factors in the capture of the data to be analysed, in particular when dealing with &ldquo;non-cooperative&rdquo; image capture. The <strong>resolution of the camera</strong>, and in particular the key variable of Pixels per Meter (minimum 300 PPM is generally required) is instrumental in ensuring that enough information is provided to the algorithm. <strong>Lighting conditions</strong> are similarly important. Although increasingly cameras add an infra-red channel to the RGB channels in order to recover detail in low-light conditions, inadequately illuminated faces will generate a high number of errors. <strong>Orientation of the face</strong> in relation to the camera is one more key factor to take into account, especially because a camera will rarely be mounted at face level (more likely overhead), and thus difficult angles will often result in partial representation of faces (Fernandez et al. 2020,&nbsp;29). <strong>Vision can often be blocked</strong> by other factors, such as other individuals in large crowds, sunglasses, masks (in particular in times of COVID-19). <strong>Obstruction can be voluntary</strong> when individuals for example look down to avoid surveillance. Finally, not all systems have a <strong>liveness detection</strong> system, meaning that they can be tricked by a photograph of a face instead of a real face. (IPVM Team 2020, 12&ndash;13)</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Current deployments of RBI technologies within Europe are primarily experimental and localised. However, the technology coexists with a broad range of algorithmic processing of security images being carried out on a scale which ranges from the individual level to what could be classed as biometric mass surveillance. Distinguishing the various characteristics of these deployments is not only important to inform the public debate, but also helps to focus the discussion on the most problematic uses of the technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Image and sound-based security applications being used for authentication purposes do not currently pose a risk for biometric mass surveillance.&nbsp;However, it should be noted that an alteration to the legal framework could increase the risk of them being deployed for biometric mass surveillance especially as many of the databases being used contain millions of data subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to authentication, image and sound-based security applications are being deployed for surveillance. Surveillance applications include the deployment of RBI in public spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress on two fronts makes the development of biometric mass surveillance more than a remote possibility. Firstly, the current creation and/or upgrading of biometric databases being used in civil and criminal registries. Secondly, the repeated piloting of live-feed systems connected to remote facial and biometric information search and recognition algorithms. &nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>When looking at the map of actual deployments of image and sound-based security technologies in Europe, <strong>Remote Biometric Identification</strong> is, as this report is being written, so far mostly an <strong>experimental and localised</strong> application. It coexists alongside a broad range of algorithmic processing of security images in a spectrum that goes from individual, localised authentication systems to generalised law enforcement uses of authentication, to what can properly be defined as Biometric Mass Surveillance. <strong>Distinguishing the various characteristics</strong> of these deployments is not only important to inform the public debate, but it also <strong>helps focus the discussion on the most problematic uses of the technologies</strong>. It also highlights the risks of <strong>function creep</strong>: systems deployed for one use which is respectful of EU fundamental rights can in some cases very easily be upgraded to function as biometric mass surveillance.</p>
<p>The European map of image and sound-based security technologies can be divided into two broad categories: <strong>authentication applications</strong> and <strong>surveillance applications</strong>. <strong>Remote Biometric Identification is a sub-category of the latter</strong>.</p>
<section>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>A broad range of deployments, which we consider in this first section, is not aimed at surveillance, but at authentication (see section 2.3 in this report), namely making sure that the person in front of the security camera is who they say they are.</p>
<section>
<h3>Live authentication</h3>
<p>As in the cases of the use of <a>Cisco systems</a> powered FRT in two pilot projects in <strong><a>high schools of Nice</a></strong> (see section 8.1) <strong>and <a>Marseille</a> (France)</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn9" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>9</sup></a>, or as in the case of the <strong><a>Anderstorp Upper Secondary School</a> in Skelleftea (Sweden)</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn10" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>10</sup></a>, the aim of these projects was to identify students who could have access to the premises. School-wide biometric databases were generated and populated with students&rsquo; portraits. Gates were fitted with cameras connected to facial recognition technology and allowed access only to recognised students. Another documented use has been for the <strong><a>Home Quarantine App (Hungary)</a></strong>, in which telephone cameras are used by authorities to verify the identity of the persons logged into the app (see also section 10.1).</p>
<p>In these deployments, people must submit themselves to the camera in order to be identified and gain access. While these techniques of identification pose <strong>important threats to the privacy of the concerned small groups of users</strong> (in both high school cases, DPAs banned the use of FRTs), and run the risk of false positives (unauthorised people recognised as authorised) or false negatives (authorised people not recognised as such) <strong>the risk of biometric mass surveillance strictly speaking is low to non-existent because of the nature of the acquisition of images and other sensor-based data.</strong></p>
<p>However, other forms of live authentication tie in with surveillance practices, in particular various forms of <strong>blacklisting</strong>. With blacklisting the face of every passer-by is compared to a list of faces of individuals who have been rejected access to the premises. In such an instance, people do not have to be identified, as long as an image of their face is provided. This has been used in public places, for example in the case of the <a>Korte Putstraat</a> in the Dutch city of 's-Hertogenbosch: during the carnival festivities of 2019 two people were rejected access to the street after they were singled out by the system (Gotink, 2019). It is unclear how many false positives were generated during this period. Other cases of blacklisting can be found at, for example, access control at various football stadiums in Europe, see also section 3.3. In many cases of blacklisting, individuals do not enrol voluntarily.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Forensic authentication</h3>
<p>Biometric systems for the purposes of authentication are also increasingly deployed for <strong>forensic applications</strong> among law-enforcement agencies in the European Union. The typical scenario for the use of such technologies is to match the photograph of a suspect (extracted, for example, from previous records or from CCTV footage) against an existing dataset of known individuals (e.g., a national biometric database, a driver&rsquo;s license database, etc.). (TELEFI, 2021). The development of these forensic authentication capabilities is particularly relevant to this study, because it entails making large databases ready for searches on the basis of biometric information.</p>
<p>To date, <strong>11 out of 27 member states of the <a>European Union</a></strong> are using facial recognition against biometric databases for forensic purposes: <strong>Austria</strong> (<a>EDE</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn11" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a>, <strong>Finland</strong> (<a>KASTU</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn12" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>12</sup></a>, <strong>France</strong> (<a>TAJ</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn13" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>13</sup></a>, <strong>Germany</strong> (<a>INPOL</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn14" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>14</sup></a>, <strong>Greece</strong> (<a>Mugshot Database</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn15" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>15</sup></a>, <strong>Hungary</strong> (<a>Facial Image Registry</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn16" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>16</sup></a>, <strong>Italy</strong> (<a>AFIS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn17" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>17</sup></a>, <strong>Latvia</strong> (<a>BDAS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn18" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>18</sup></a>, <strong>Lithuania</strong> (<a>HDR</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn19" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>19</sup></a>, <strong>Netherlands</strong> (<a>CATCH</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn20" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>20</sup></a> and <strong>Slovenia</strong> (<a>Record of Photographed Persons</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn21" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>21</sup></a> (TELEFI 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Seven additional countries</strong> are expected to acquire such capabilities in the near future: <strong>Croatia</strong> (<a>ABIS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn22" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>22</sup></a>, <strong>Czech Republic</strong> (<a>CBIS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn23" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>23</sup></a>, <strong>Portugal</strong> (<a>AFIS</a>) <strong>Romania</strong> (<a>NBIS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn24" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>24</sup></a>, <strong>Spain</strong> (<a>ABIS</a>), <strong><a>Sweden</a></strong> (<a>National Mugshot Database</a>), <strong>Cyprus</strong> (<a>ISIS Faces</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn25" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>25</sup></a>, <strong><a>Estonia</a></strong> (<a>ABIS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn26" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>26</sup></a> (TELEFI 2021).</p>
<p>When it comes to international institutions, <strong><a>Interpol</a></strong> (2020) has a facial recognition system (<a>IFRS</a>)<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn27" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>27</sup></a>, based on facial images received from more than 160 countries. <strong><a>Europol</a></strong> has two sub-units which use the facial recognition search tool and database known as <a>FACE</a>: the European Counter Terrorism Center (ECTC) and the European Cybercrime Center (ECC). (TELEFI, 2021 149-153) (Europol 2020)</p>
<p><strong>Only 9 countries in the EU so far have rejected or do not plan to implement</strong> FRT for forensic purposes: <strong>Belgium</strong> (see CHAPTER 6), <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>Denmark</strong>, <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Luxembourg</strong>, <strong>Malta</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong>, <strong>Portugal</strong>, <strong>Slovakia</strong>.</p>

<p>Figure 1. EU Countries use of FRT for forensic applications<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn28" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>When it comes to databases</strong>, some countries limit the searches to <strong>criminal databases</strong> (Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Lithuania, UK), while other countries open the searches to <strong>civil databases</strong> (Finland, Netherlands, Latvia, Hungary).</p>
<p>This means that the <strong>person categories can vary substantially.</strong> In the case of criminal databases it can range from suspects and convicts, to asylum seekers, aliens, unidentified persons, immigrants, visa applicants. When <strong>civil databases</strong> are used as well, such as in Hungary, the database contains a broad range of &ldquo;individuals of known identity from various document/civil proceedings&rdquo; (TELEFI 2021, appendix 3).</p>
<p><strong>Finally, the database sizes</strong>, in comparison to the authentication databases mentioned in the previous section, are of a different magnitude. The databases of school students in France and Sweden, mentioned in the previous section contains a few hundred entries. National databases can contain instead several millions. Criminal databases such as Germany&rsquo;s INPOL contains <strong>6,2 million individuals</strong>, France&rsquo;s <a>TAJ</a> <strong>21 million individuals</strong> and <a>Italy&rsquo;s AFIS</a> <strong>9 million individuals.</strong> Civil databases, such as Hungary&rsquo;s Facial Image Registry contain <strong>30 million templates</strong> (TELEFI, 2021 appendix 3).</p>
<p>Authentication has also been deployed as part of integrated &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; solutions, such as the <strong><a>NEC</a> Technology <a>Bio-IDiom system in Lisbon</a> and London,</strong> deployed for forensic investigation purposes. For this specific product, authentication can occur via facial recognition, as well as other biometric authentication techniques such as <strong>ear acoustics, iris, voice, fingerprint, and finger vein recognition</strong>. We currently do not have public information on the use of <a>Bio-IDiom in Lisbon</a> nor in London. On <a>NEC</a>&rsquo;s Website (2021) however, Bio-IDiom is advertised as a &ldquo;multimodal&rdquo; identification system, that has been used for example by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department (LASD) for criminal investigations. The system &ldquo;combines multiple biometric technologies including fingerprint, palm print, face, and iris recognition&rdquo; and works &ldquo;based on the few clues left behind at crime scenes. In Los Angeles, &ldquo;this system is also connected to the databases of federal and state law enforcement agencies such as the California Department of Justice and FBI, making it the world&rsquo;s largest-scale service-based biometrics system for criminal investigation&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t know if that is the case in Portugal and in the UK deployments.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Case study: INPOL (Germany)</h3>
<p>In order to give a concrete example of the forensic use of biometric technology, we can take the German case. Germany has been using <strong>automated facial recognition</strong> technologies to identify criminal activity since 2008 using a central criminal information system called <strong><a>INPOL</a> (Informationssystem Polizei)</strong>, maintained by the <strong><a>Bundeskriminalamt</a> (BKA)</strong>, which is the federal criminal police office. INPOL uses <strong><a>Oracle Software</a></strong> and includes the following information: name, aliases, date and place of birth, nationality, fingerprints, mugshots, appearance, information about criminal histories such as prison sentences or violence of an individual, and DNA information. However, DNA information is not automatically recorded (TELEFI 2021).</p>
<p>The <a>INPOL</a> database includes <strong>facial images of suspects, arrestees, missing persons, and convicted individuals</strong>. For the purpose of facial recognition, anatomical features of a person's face or head as seen on video surveillance or images are used as a material to match with data in <a>INPOL</a>. The facial recognition system compares templates and lists all the matches ordered by degree of accordance. The BKA has specific personnel visually analysing the system's choices and providing an assessment, defining the probability of identifying a person. This assessment can be used in a court of law if necessary (Bundeskriminalamt, n.d.). Searches in the database are conducted by using <a>Cognitec</a> Face VACS software (TELEFI 2021).</p>
<p>As of March 2020, <strong><a>INPOL</a></strong> consists of <strong>5,8 million images of about 3,6 million individuals</strong>. All police stations in Germany have access to this database. The BKA saves biometric data and can be used by other ministries as well, for instance, to identify asylum seekers. Furthermore, the data is shared in the context of the <strong>Pr&uuml;m cooperation</strong> on an international level (mostly fingerprints and DNA patterns). Furthermore, the <strong>BKA</strong> saves <strong>DNA analysis data as part of <a>INPOL</a></strong>, accessible for all police stations in Germany. That database contains <strong>1,2 million data sets</strong> (Bundeskriminalamt, n.d.). Other recorded facial images, for instance, driver&rsquo;s licenses or passports, are not included in the search, and the database is mainly used for police work (TELEFI 2021).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>A blurred boundary between authentication and surveillance</h3>
<p>In principle, because of the strict legal framework to which law enforcement agencies are submitted, <strong>forensic biometric identification</strong> should not present a <strong>risk of biometric mass surveillance</strong>. The acquisition of images and the subsequent one-to-one searches are carried out as part of judicial investigations when a legal threshold of suspicion is met. The operation of the system by specialised forensic departments should follow the procedural limits set by the judicial process.</p>
<p><strong>Function creep is however particularly concerning.</strong> If the legal framework is altered to allow the acquisition of live video, and if live searches on these are legally authorised against existing criminal and civil databases, then from a technical perspective it can be argued that there is <strong>potentially a risk of biometric mass surveillance. The main risk here being that the individuals whose identities are searched or tagged are not selected as a result of a judicial investigation, but indiscriminately. The system in place would then allow for search of these individuals against huge databases.</strong> In other words, <strong>by creating new biometric databases or upgrading existing databases to be FRT-readable</strong>, and developing or acquiring algorithmic capabilities to search them, law enforcement agencies across Europe are <strong>building an infrastructure which is technically capable of &ldquo;switching&rdquo; easily to a mode of operation akin to biometric mass surveillance.</strong></p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Surveillance</h2>
<p>A second broad use of image and audio-based security technologies is for surveillance purposes. Here again, it is important, we suggest, to distinguish between two broad categories.</p>
<section>
<h3>Smart surveillance features</h3>
<p>A first range of deployments of <strong>&ldquo;smart&rdquo; systems</strong> correspond to what can broadly be defined as &ldquo;smart surveillance&rdquo; yet <strong>do not collect or process biometric information per se</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn29" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>29</sup></a>. Smart systems can be used <strong>ex-post</strong>, <strong>to assist CCTV camera operators</strong> in processing large amounts of <strong>recorded information</strong>, or can guide their attention when they have to monitor a large number of <strong>live video feeds</strong> simultaneously. Smart surveillance uses the following features:</p>
<p><strong>- Anomaly detection. <a>In Toulouse</a> (France), the City Council commissioned <a>IBM</a> to connect 30 video surveillance cameras to software able to "assist human decisions" by raising alerts when "abnormal events are detected." (Technopolice 2021) The request was justified by the &ldquo;difficulties of processing the images generated daily by the 350 cameras and kept for 30 days (more than 10,000 images per second)&rdquo;. The objective, according to the digital direction is "to optimise and structure the supervision of video surveillance operators by generating alerts through a system of intelligent analysis that facilitates the identification of anomalies detected, whether: movements of crowds, isolated luggage, crossing virtual barriers north of the Garonne, precipitous movement, research of shapes and colour. All these detections are done in real time or delayed (Technopolice 2021). In other words, the anomaly detection is a way to <em>operationalise</em> the numerical output of various computer vision based recognition systems. Similar systems are used</strong> in the <strong>Smart video surveillance deployment in Valenciennes (France)</strong> or in the <strong>Urban Surveillance Centre (Marseille).</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Object Detection.</strong> In Amsterdam, around the <strong><a>Johan Cruijff ArenA</a></strong> (Stadium), the city has been experimenting with a <strong><a>Digitale Perimeter</a></strong> (digital perimeter) surveillance system. In addition to the usual features of facial recognition, and crowd monitorining, the system includes the possibility of automatically detecting specific objects such as <strong>weapons, fireworks</strong> or <strong>drones</strong>. Similar features are found in <strong><a>Inwebit</a>&rsquo;s <a>Smart Security Platform</a> (SSP) in Poland.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Feature search. In <a>Marbella</a> (Spain), <a>Avigilon</a> deployed <a>a smart camera system</a> aimed at providing &ldquo;smart&rdquo; functionalities without biometric data. Since regional law bans facial and biometric identification without consent, the software uses &ldquo;appearance search&rdquo;. &ldquo;Appearance search&rdquo; provides estimates for &ldquo;unique facial traits, the colour of a person&rsquo;s clothes, age, shape, gender and hair colour&rdquo;. This information is not considered biometric. The individual&rsquo;s features can be used to search for suspects fitting a particular profile. Similar technology has been <a>deployed in Kortrijk</a> (Belgium), which provides search parameters for people, vehicles and animals</strong> (Verbeke 2019). <strong>During the Covid-19 pandemic, several initiatives emerged to automatically detect whether the mask mandates were observed by the public, such as in the <a>aborted face mask recognition project in Ch&acirc;telet-Les Halles</a> developed by the company <a>Datakalab</a>.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Video summary.</strong> Some companies, such as <strong><a>Briefcam</a></strong> and their product <strong>Briefcam Review</strong>, offer a related product, which promises to shorten the analysis of long hours of CCTV footage, by identifying specific topics of interest (children, women, lighting changes) and making the footage searchable. The product combines face recognition, license plate recognition, and more mundane video analysis features such as the possibility to overlay selected scenes, thus highlighting recurrent points of activity in the image. Briefcam is deployed in several cities across Europe, including <a>Vannes</a>, <a>Roubaix</a> (in partnership with <strong><a>Eiffage</a></strong> managed by <strong>the <a>City of Roubaix</a></strong> and the <strong><a>M&eacute;tropole Europ&eacute;enne de Lille</a></strong>) and <a>Moirans</a> in France (with equipment provided by <strong><a>Nomadys</a></strong>).</p>
<p><strong>- Object detection and object tracking. As outlined in chapter 2, object detection is often the first step in the various digital detection applications for images. An &lsquo;object&rsquo; here can mean anything the computer is conditioned to search for: a suitcase, a vehicle, but also a person; while some products further process the detected object to estimate particular features, such as the colour of a vehicle, the age of a person. However, on some occasions &mdash; often to address concerns over privacy &mdash; only the position of the object on the image is stored. This is for example the case with the</strong> test of the <strong><a>One-and-a-half-meter monitor</a> in Amsterdam (Netherlands), <a>Intemo</a>&rsquo;s <a>people counting system in Nijmegen</a> (Netherlands),</strong> the <a>ViSense social distancing monitor</a> at MINDBase, a testing location of the <strong><a>Dutch Defence Equipment Organization</a></strong>;  the <strong><a>KICK project</a></strong> in <strong><a>Brugge</a></strong>, <strong><a>Kortrijk</a></strong>, <strong><a>Ieper</a></strong>, <strong><a>Roeselare</a></strong> and <strong><a>Oostende</a></strong> <strong>(Belgium), the <a>ViSense project in Mechelen</a> (Belgium)</strong> or the <strong><a>Eco-counter</a></strong> <strong><a>tracking cameras pilot project</a></strong> in <strong><a>Lannion</a> (France).</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Movement recognition. <a>Avigilon</a>&rsquo;s software that is deployed in Marbella (Spain) also detects unusual movement. &ldquo;To avoid graffiti, we can calculate the time someone takes to pass a shop window, &ldquo;explained Javier Mart&iacute;n, local chief of police in Marbella to the Spanish newspaper El Pa&iacute;s. &ldquo;If it takes them more than 10 seconds, the camera is activated to see if they are graffitiing. So far, it hasn&rsquo;t been activated.&rdquo; (Colom&eacute; 2019) Similar movement recognition technology is used in, the ViSense deployment at the Olympic Park London (UK) and the <a>security camera system in Mechelen-Willebroek</a> (Belgium). It should be noted that movement</strong> recognition can be done in two ways: where projects such as the <strong><a>Data-lab Burglary-free Neighbourhood</a> in Rotterdam (Netherlands)</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn30" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>30</sup></a> are only based on the tracking of trajectories of people through an image (see also &lsquo;Object detection&rsquo;), cases such as <strong>the <a>Living Lab Stratumseind</a></strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn31" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>31</sup></a> <strong>in Eindhoven (Netherlands)</strong> also process the movements and gestures of individuals in order to estimate their behaviour.</p>
<section>
<h4>Audio recognition</h4>
<p>- In addition to image (video) based products, some deployments use audio recognition to complement the decision-making process, for example used in the <strong><a>Serenecity</a> (a branch of <a>Verney-Carron</a>) Project in Saint-Etienne (France)</strong>, the <strong><a>Smart CCTV deployment in public transportation</a> in <a>Rouen</a> (France)</strong> or the <strong><a>Smart CCTV system in Strasbourg</a> (France)</strong>. The <a>project piloted in Saint-Etienne</a> for example, worked by placing &ldquo;audio capture devices&rdquo; - the term microphone was avoided- in strategic parts of the city. Sounds qualified by an anomaly detection algorithm as suspicious would then alert operators in the Urban Supervision Center, prompting further investigation via CCTV or deployment of the necessary services (healthcare or police for example) (France 3 Auvergne-Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes 2019.)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Emotion recognition</h4>
<p>- <strong>Emotion recognition</strong> is a rare occurrence. We found evidence of its deployment only in a <strong><a>pilot project in Nice</a> (see section 8.1)</strong> and in the <strong><a>Citybeacon</a> project in Eindhoven, but even then, the project was never actually tested. The original idea proposed by the company <a>Two-I</a> was &ldquo;a "real-time emotional mapping" capable of highlighting "potentially problematic or even dangerous situations". "A dynamic deployment of security guards in an area where tension and stress are felt, is often a simple way to avoid any overflow," also argues <a>Two-I</a>, whose "Security" software would be able to decipher some 10,000 faces per second. (Binacchi 2019)</strong></p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Gait recognition</h4>
<p><strong>Gait recognition is currently not deployed in Europe. To our knowledge, o</strong>nly one company, <strong>Watrix (a company based in China)</strong>, has commercialised gait recognition, but only in China (Segal 2020, 2).</p>

<h3>Integrated solutions </h3>
<section>
<h4>Smart cities</h4>
<p>While some cities or companies decide to implement some of the functionalities with their existing or updated CCTV systems, several chose to centralise several of these &ldquo;smart&rdquo; functions in <strong>integrated systems</strong> often referred to as &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; solutions. These solutions do not necessarily process biometric information. This is the case for example for the deployments in <strong><a>TIM</a>&rsquo;s</strong>, <strong><a>Insula</a></strong> and <strong><a>Venis</a>&rsquo;</strong> <strong><a>Safe City Platform in Venice</a> (Italy)</strong>, <strong><a>Huawei</a>&rsquo;s</strong> <strong><a>Safe City in Valenciennes</a> (France)</strong>, <strong><a>Dahua&rsquo;s integrated solution in Brienon-sur-Arman&ccedil;on</a></strong> <strong>(France)</strong>, <strong><a>Thal&egrave;s</a>&rsquo; Safe City in <a>La D&eacute;fense</a> and <a>Nice</a> (France)</strong>, <strong>Engie In&eacute;o&rsquo;s and <a>SNEF</a>&rsquo;s <a>integrated solution in Marseille</a> (France)</strong>, the <strong><a>Center of Urban Supervision in Roubaix</a> (France)</strong>, <strong><a>AI Mars</a> (Madrid, in development)</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn32" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>32</sup></a> or <strong>NEC&rsquo;s platform in <a>Lisbon</a> and London</strong>.</p>
<p>The way &ldquo;Smart/Safe City&rdquo; solutions work is well exemplified by the <a>&ldquo;Control room&rdquo; deployed in Venice</a>, connected to an urban surveillance network. The system is composed of a central command and control room which aggregates cloud computing systems, together with smart cameras, artificial intelligence systems, antennas and hundreds of sensors distributed on a widespread network. The idea is to monitor what happens in the lagoon city in real time. The scope of the abilities of the centre is wide-ranging. It promises to: manage events and incoming tourist flows, something particularly relevant to a city which aims to implement a visiting fee for tourists; predict and manage weather events in advance, such as the shifting of tides and high water, by defining alternative routes for transit in the city; indicating to the population in real time the routes to avoid traffic and better manage mobility for time optimisation; improve the management of public safety allowing city agents to intervene in a more timely manner; control and manage water and road traffic, also for sanctioning purposes, through specific video-analysis systems; control the status of parking lots; monitor the environmental and territorial situation; collect, process data and information that allow for the creation of forecasting models and the allocation of resources more efficiently and effectively; bring to life a physical "Smart Control Room" where law enforcement officers train and learn how to read data as well. (LUMI 2020)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Smartphone apps</h4>
<p>Integrated solutions can entail smartphone apps, used to connect citizens with the control and command centres. This is for example the case in Nice with the (failed) <strong><a>Reporty App</a></strong> project (See Chapter 5), the <strong>Dragonfly project (Hungary) (See chapter 10)</strong> and was part of the original plan of <strong><a>Marseille&rsquo;s Safe City project</a></strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Crowd management</h4>
<p>Integrated solutions are generally comprised of a set of crowd management features, such as in the case of the systems <strong>in <a>Valenciennes</a> and <a>Marseille</a> (France), <a>Mannheim</a> (Germany), <a>Venice</a> (Italy), Amsterdam, <a>Eindhoven</a> and Den Bosch with the <a>pilot in the Korte Putstraat</a> (using software by <a>CrowdWatch</a>, Netherlands).</strong> Such crowd management software generally does not recognise individuals, but rather estimates the number of people on (a part of) the video frame. Sudden movements of groups or changes in density are then flagged for attention of the security operator (Nishiyama 2018).</p>

<h2>Remote Biometric Identification</h2>
<p>While all the deployments described above are variants of security applications of algorithmically processed images and sound, the number of deployments which match the narrow definition of <strong>Remote Biometric Identification (RBI)</strong>, namely the use of live camera feeds processed through search algorithms against pre-existing databases, is relatively small. They are often presented as &ldquo;pilots&rdquo;, limited in time and often quickly interrupted for legal reasons.</p>
<section>
<h3>Deployment of RBI in public spaces</h3>
<p>Here are the documented cases of RBI in public spaces we could find through our research:</p>
<p>- <strong>Live Facial Recognition <a>pilot project in Brussels International Airport / Zaventem</a></strong> (Belgium, see detailed case study, CHAPTER 6)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live Facial Recognition in Budapest</strong> (Hungary, see detailed case study, CHAPTER 10)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live Facial Recognition <a>pilot project during the Carnival in Nice</a></strong> (France, see detailed case study, CHAPTER 8)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live Facial Recognition <a>Pilot Project S&uuml;dkreuz Berlin</a></strong> (Germany, see detailed case study, CHAPTER 9)</p>
<p>As most of these cases are extensively discussed in the following chapters, we do not comment further on them here.</p>
<p>Additional cases are the <strong><a></a>Live Facial Recognition pilot during Carnival 2019 in 's-Hertogenbosch&rsquo;s Korte Putstraat</strong> (the Netherlands) and the pilot of <strong><a>Live Facial Recognition in the city of Como</a></strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn33" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>33</sup></a>, recently struck down by the Italian DPA (<a>Garante per la Privacy</a>). The deployment of facial recognition in <strong><a>Estacion Sur</a></strong> in Madrid (Spain) is also live.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Deployment of RBI in commercial spaces</h3>
<p>The number of deployments of live facial recognition systems in commercial spaces hosting the public is much higher, but because of its commercial nature, difficult to document and trace. Our research found the following instances:</p>
<p>- <strong><a>Live Facial Recognition project, Br&oslash;ndby IF Football stadium</a></strong> (Denmark)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live <a>Facial Recognition Pilot in Metz Stadium</a></strong> (France)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live <a>Facial Recognition in Ifema</a></strong> (Spain)</p>
<p>- <strong>Live <a>Facial Recognition in Mercadona</a> or Mallorca, Zaragoza, Valencia</strong> (Spain)</p>
<p>The systems operate more or less in the same way as RBI in public spaces, or as forensic authentication systems if they were connected to live cameras. In the <strong><a>Br&oslash;ndby IF Football stadium deployment</a> for example</strong>, developed in partnership with <strong><a>Panasonic</a></strong> and the <strong><a>National University of Singapore</a></strong>, the football fans who want to access the game have to pass through a gate equipped with a camera, connected to a facial recognition algorithm. The stadium administration has constituted a database of unwanted individuals and if the software matches one of the incoming fans with a record in the database, it flags it to the system (Overgaard 2019).</p>
<p>There is however little to no information of the uses of these technologies in commercial spaces, as there is no requirement to publicise the various components of these systems. The case studies of this report thus focus mostly on the deployment of RBI in public spaces. More research, and more transparency would however be welcome in order to understand the data gathering practices and the impact of these deployments.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude the overview of the deployment of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; security applications in Europe, &ldquo;actually existing&rdquo; <strong>Remote Biometric Identification deployments are a rare occurrence</strong>, <strong>but</strong> they are part of a much broader infrastructure of automated biometric authentication and smart surveillance that are increasingly maturing. The existence of this broader technical infrastructure means that while all the components necessary for biometric mass surveillance are not yet assembled, if given the legal authorisation, <strong>Remote Biometric Identification could potentially be deployed at a scale that could enact Biometric Mass Surveillance.</strong></p>
<p>That this is more than a remote possibility as evidenced by progress in two directions that are necessary pre-conditions for Biometric Mass Surveillance: 1) The creation of large, new biometric databases, or the upgrading of existing databases, <strong>both of civil and criminal registries</strong>, so that they can be searched by FRT and other biometric recognition algorithms <strong>on a broad scale</strong> by country-wide agencies. 2) The repeated <strong>piloting</strong> and <strong>experimentation</strong> of live-feed systems connected to remote facial and biometric information search and recognition algorithms. The evolution of these two developments (database integration and live deployment pilots), while carried out in general by different categories of actors (national law enforcement for the former, municipal police and city authorities for the latter) <strong>should however be analysed together</strong>, and given a permissive legislative framework, they demonstrate the <strong>plausible characteristics of potential technical systems of Biometric Mass Surveillance.</strong> In the following chapter, we explore the current legal framework that limits the existing technological developments and explore the growing jurisprudence on the matter.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of biometric tools for law enforcement purposes in public spaces raises a key issue of the legal permissibility in relation to the collection, retention and processing of data when considering the individual&rsquo;s fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection. When viewed through this lens, RBI technologies could have a grave impact on the exercise of a range of fundamental rights.</p></li>
<li><p>The deployment of biometric surveillance in public spaces must be subject to strict scrutiny in order to avoid circumstances which could lead to mass surveillance.

<li><p>The European Commission&rsquo;s April 2021 proposal on the Regulation for the Artificial Intelligence Act aims to harmonise regulatory rules for Member States on AI-based systems. The Proposed Regulation lays out rules focussed on three categories of risks (unacceptable, high, and low/ minimal risk) and anticipates covering the use of RBI systems. It also aims to compliment the rules and obligations set out in the GDPR and LED.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>The deployment of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> in public spaces might have grave effects on the exercise of a range of <strong>fundamental rights of individuals</strong> (FRA 2019) such as the right to peaceful assembly and association (UNHRC 2019,&nbsp;para. 57) and the <strong>rights to liberty and security</strong>. Because <strong>the use of biometric tools for law enforcement purposes in public spaces involves&nbsp;collection, retention and processing of biometric data</strong>, a key issue on their legal permissibility is raised in relation to the obligations under the fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection. This section thus will consider remote biometric identification against the protection offered by EU fundamental rights framework for the rights to privacy and personal data protection as well as by EU data protection legislation.</p>
<section>
<h2>EU Fundamental Rights Framework for the Right to Privacy and the Right to Protection of Personal Data </h2>
<section>
<h3>The scope of the fundamental right to protection for RBI&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Article 7</strong> of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Charter) sets out national and EU legislators&rsquo; obligations on guaranteeing <strong>the right to private life, family life, and communications of individuals (the right to privacy) under EU law</strong>. The right to privacy can also be found in <strong>Article 8</strong> of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the scope of which has evolved over the years to cover issues relating to the processing of personal data. Because <strong>Article 7</strong> of the Charter mirrors closely <strong>Article 8 ECHR</strong>, its scope must be interpreted in line with the latter and its interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Charter. The Charter enshrines a separate right to protection of personal data in its Article 8, which is &ldquo;distinct from Article 7 of the Charter&rdquo; (C-203/15, <em>Tele2</em>, para. 129).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biometric surveillance tools interfere with the <strong>fundamental rights to privacy</strong> and <strong>personal data protection</strong> as enshrined in each of these legal sources because they collect, retain, process and use personal data, including an intrinsically special category of biometric data, <strong>which is - as discussed below, personal data relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of an individual that allows their unique identification (see section 4.2.1)</strong>. Notably, it may not be just the physical biometric data such as fingerprints (<em>S and Marper v UK</em>; C-291/12&nbsp;, <em>Schwarz</em>) or facial images (<em>Gaughran v UK</em>) that benefits from the rights to privacy and personal data protection as enshrined in the ECHR and EU law. For example, the ECtHR has adopted an expansive approach in terms of recognising the protective scope of Article 8 ECHR (<em>S and Marper v UK</em>, para 67), which would afford protection to <strong>different categories of biometric data including behavioural biometric data such as one&rsquo;s way of movement or voice</strong> (Venier and Mordini, 2010).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Privacy and data protection in public space and the risk of mass surveillance</h3>
<p>The use of a wide range of biometric data discussed above engages with the individuals&rsquo; <strong>right to privacy and data protection</strong> even if they are captured and used in public spaces while individuals enjoy public life.&nbsp;The case law of the ECtHR (<em>PG and JH v UK</em>; <em>Peck v UK</em>) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (Opinion 1/15) shows that they have afforded privacy protection to information that is not inherently private.&nbsp;In fact, <strong>performing biometric surveillance in public spaces is inherently intrusive and amounts to mass surveillance</strong>, which&nbsp;in this context can simply be characterised as <strong>monitoring, tracking, or processing of personal data of individuals indiscriminately and in a generalised manner without a prior criminal suspicion (FRA 2018</strong>). Biometric surveillance in public spaces relies on generalised and indiscriminate collection, retention, use and sharing of biometric data of individuals<strong>. This is the case even if the intended purpose of the biometric surveillance is targeted</strong>, because in order to identify people on the watchlist in a crowd, every person in that particular space must be analysed and compared with the watchlist (Houwing 2020).</p>

<p>The grave consequences of this type of indiscriminate and generalised collection of personal data on fundamental rights of individuals can be found across the case law of the ECtHR and the CJEU. The ECtHR has repeatedly warned that covert surveillance tools <strong>must not be used to undermine or even destroy democracy on the grounds of defending it</strong> (<em>Klass and others v Germany</em>, para 49). Particularly in considering the lawfulness of collection of biometric data, the ECtHR recognised in&nbsp;<em>S and Marper v UK</em>&nbsp;that the use of biometric data that would allow identification of an individual and would carry the potential to deduce personal data that is classified as sensitive data such as ethnic origin would make&nbsp;the people concerned fundamentally vulnerable to stigmatisation and discrimination (paras 122-126). Because of the heightened level of protection afforded to it, <strong>the ECtHR found that generalised and indiscriminate collection and retention of biometric data did not comply with the ECHR requirements as it amounted to disproportionate interference with the right to privacy and thus constitute a violation of Article 8 ECHR.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The CJEU considered in&nbsp;<em>Digital Rights Ireland</em>&nbsp;(Joined Cases C293/12 and C594/12, para 37) as well as&nbsp;<em>Tele2</em>&nbsp;(C-203/15, para 100) that EU law <strong>precluded the</strong> <strong>mass retention of traffic and location data for law enforcement purposes</strong>, and only allowed for targeted retention of said data. The deployment of biometric surveillance in public spaces thus must be subject to <strong>strict scrutiny</strong> and in light of the case law of both courts, the EU fundamental rights law as well as the ECHR preclude the deployment of biometric surveillance that leads to mass surveillance for law enforcement purposes in public spaces.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>The ambiguities of &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; biometric surveillance</h3>
<p><strong>Targeted biometric</strong> surveillance may still be lawful provided that it is justified under <strong>Article 52(1)</strong> of the Charter in light of the ECHR requirements for the Convention rights that are mirrored in the Charter. <strong>This type of surveillance is distinguishable from mass surveillance as it is directed towards a person or group of persons based on a prior suspicion on their involvement with criminal activities.</strong> Recently in its&nbsp;<em>La Quadrature du net and others</em>&nbsp;decision, the CJEU added <strong>a geographical criterion as a satisfactory limitation for a targeted retention of traffic and location data</strong> (para 149). However, in the context of conducting biometric surveillance in public spaces, this might not be a limitation as such.&nbsp;As mentioned above, by its nature this type of surveillance would amount to mass surveillance since it would indiscriminately monitor and analyse everyone in that space to detect people on the watchlist. <strong>Accordingly, using biometric surveillance in a specific area (e.g., concert venues, football stadiums, public rallies) for law enforcement purposes might be considered as expansive and intrusive to an extent that it would constitute disproportionate interference with the rights to privacy and personal data protection</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Conditions for &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; biometric surveillance</h3>
<p>Even where biometric surveillance is performed in a targeted way, <strong>its lawfulness would turn on the legitimate aim</strong> for which it is conducted and an <strong>assessment on its proportionality</strong> in light of that aim. A key issue here is that conducting targeted biometric surveillance in public spaces would constitute a serious interference with the rights to privacy and personal data protection because of the special character of biometric data that makes a person unique and identifiable and potentially carries the risk to reveal sensitive data. Thus, it should be conducted for an aim that is proportionate to the level of intrusiveness caused by it (by analogy&nbsp;C-203/15,&nbsp;<em>Tele2</em>, para 102). In essence, this means that targeted biometric surveillance is only allowed if it is strictly necessary for the purpose of fighting against terrorism or serious crime (by analogy&nbsp;C-203/15,&nbsp;<em>Tele2)</em>. There must be appropriate safeguards protecting people concerned from possible abusive uses of biometric surveillance. Moreover, there must be effective legal remedies available to people regarding the use of biometric surveillance. Authorisations for targeted biometric surveillance must be subject to effective review by a court or an independence administrative body who has the power to issue legally binding decisions to verify that a situation justifying the recourse to the measure exists and the conditions and safeguards are observed (C&#8209;511/18, C&#8209;512/18 and C&#8209;520/18, <em>La Quadrature du Net and others, para 179).</em></p>
<p><strong>A fundamental rights assessment</strong> of conducting targeted biometric surveillance in public spaces must be carried out in each stage of the data lifecycle, <strong>including when the data is processed in near real-time before collection.</strong> Especially where the personal data captured in the public sphere in real-time involves the use of data that the individual may not foresee (<em>Uzun v Germany</em>, para 45), that real-time automated processing would trigger an <strong>Article 8</strong> protection. Similarly in the context of the right to personal data protection, the CJEU found in&nbsp;<em>La Quadrature du Net and others&nbsp;</em>(C&#8209;511/18, C&#8209;512/18 and C&#8209;520/18)&nbsp;that the <strong>automated analysis of personal data amounted to an interference with the right to protection of personal data as set out in Article 8 of the Charter</strong>, even though it did not initially involve the collection of the data (para 170). Based on the case law of both courts, the <strong>automated analysis of biometric data in and of itself amounts to an interference</strong> with the right to privacy and personal data protection and <strong>must meet the fundamental rights requirements</strong> to be lawful. Accordingly, it must be subject to review by a court or an independent administrative body, and the pre-established tools or models used in the automated analysis must meet certain qualities (e.g., they must non-discriminatory, specific, and reliable; any positive result must be subject to manual and individual re-examination) (C&#8209;511/18, C&#8209;512/18 and C&#8209;520/18, <em>La Quadrature du Net and others, paras 180-182).</em></p>

<section>
<h2>EU Secondary Law: GDPR &amp; LED </h2>
<p>The normative legal framework for conducting biometric surveillance in public spaces can be found in the EU secondary legislation on data protection. The use of biometric data under this framework must be reviewed in light of the protection offered by fundamental rights (Section a).</p>
<section>
<h3>&ldquo;Biometric data&rdquo; in GDPR &amp; LED</h3>
<p><strong>The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)</strong> provides the rules relating to the processing of personal data for all purposes except where the processing is carried out for the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public safety pursuant to its <strong>Article 2(2)(d)</strong>. <strong>The Law Enforcement Directive (LED)</strong> complements the GDPR in this area as it applies specifically to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offences including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public safety pursuant to its <strong>Article 1</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both legislations provide a specific framework for the processing of special categories of data (formerly known as &ldquo;sensitive data&rdquo;) &ndash; including <strong>biometric data</strong>, which is defined as <strong>&ldquo;personal data&rdquo; resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or &ldquo;dactyloscopic data&rdquo;</strong> under <strong>Article 4(14) of the GDPR</strong> and <strong>Article 3(13) of the LED</strong>. The definition thus recognises expanding categories of biometric data that can capture and measure human characteristics as it covers physical and physiological as well as behavioural biometric data. Notably, <strong>biometric data</strong> is granted a <strong>higher protection</strong> than <strong>non-sensitive personal data</strong> irrespective of the fact that they may not reveal sensitive information such as <strong>racial or ethnic origin</strong>, <strong>health</strong>, or <strong>sexual orientation</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Distinguishing personal data and biometric data</h3>
<p>There are two elements that need to be sought for the <strong>personal data</strong> to constitute <strong>biometric data</strong> and for their processing to be subject to the specific limitations imposed by the GDPR and the LED.</p>
<p><strong>- &ldquo;Specific technical process&rdquo;.</strong> Neither legislation defines the concept &ldquo;specific technical process&rdquo; but it should be understood as a special type of processing that captures the digital representation of biometric characteristics (e.g., facial images, fingerprints, voice) (Kindt 2013, 43; Jasserand 2016, 303). On this point, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB, 2019) notes that <strong>biometric data are the result of measurement of physical, physiological, or behavioural characteristics of individuals and thus the result of this special type of processing is captured by the concept of biometric data.</strong> For example, the image of the person captured by video surveillance is personal data, but it would be classified as biometric data once it is subjected to a specific type of processing to deduce the characteristics of that person (Recital 51, GDPR).</p>

<p>- &ldquo;<strong>Unique identification of an individual</strong>&rdquo;. Compared to the definition of <strong>personal data</strong>, it is unclear whether the element of identification for the purpose of defining biometric data requires a higher threshold (Jasserand 2013, 305-306). Both legislations define personal data broadly, as &ldquo;any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual&rdquo;. It has been confirmed both by the former Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (2007) and the CJEU (<em>C-582/14, Breyer</em>) that the personal data is broadly defined to capture <strong>the concept of &ldquo;identifiability&rdquo;</strong> whereby a person could be identifiable combined with other information available (including the information retained by someone other than the data controller) <strong>even if the person is not&nbsp;<em>prima facie</em>&nbsp;identified</strong> (paras 39-49).</p>

<p>The element of identification in the definition of biometric data on the other hand may suggest that said data must relate to an <strong>identified individual.</strong> The fact that the person could be identifiable through possible means would not be sufficient for the personal data to be classified as biometric data (Jasserand 2013, 306). <strong>The EDPB (2019) supports this view as it notes that if video surveillance system is set to detect the physical characteristics of individuals to classify them as opposed to uniquely identify them, this processing would not be subject to the framework reserved for the processing of sensitive data.</strong> Nevertheless, the data captured might still amount to personal data irrespective of the fact that they are not subject to any special type of processing.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sensitive (biometric) data processing conditions </h3>
<p>&nbsp;Both the GDPR and the LED impose a special framework <strong>for the processing of sensitive data including biometric data as opposed to non-sensitive personal data</strong>. In essence, they impose limitations on the processing of sensitive data by setting out exceptional conditions for which the data may be processed. The following section considers the conditions under the LED on the processing of biometric data in order to set out the regulatory obligations relevant to implementing biometric surveillance in public spaces for law enforcement purposes. The conditions for biometric data processing under the GDPR are excluded from the scope of this report because it does not apply to processing activities for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<section>
<h4>Conditions for the processing of biometric data under the LED</h4>
<p>The LED imposes <strong>limitations to the processing of biometric data</strong> for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual. Pursuant to its <strong>Article 10</strong>, competent authorities may process biometric data where <strong>strictly necessary</strong> (which requires a stringent balancing analysis between the data processing and its purpose) and is subject to <strong>appropriate safeguards</strong> for three purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>where authorised by EU or Member States&rsquo; national law</p></li>
<li><p>to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person</p></li>
<li><p>where the data is manifestly made public by the data subject</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the most relevant lawful ground for conducting biometric surveillance under the LED is where the processing is authorised by EU or a Member States&rsquo; national law because, for example, processing for the protection of vital interests is limited to scenarios where the data subject or another person is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, or where there is a humanitarian emergency.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the EU legislator or Member States may adopt a law on conducting biometric surveillance for law enforcement purposes, but it would be subject to the EU fundamental rights requirements and would be <strong>unlawful</strong> <strong>if it affects the essence of the fundamental rights or if it amounts to a disproportionate interference</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Automated decision-making under the LED</h4>
<p><strong>Member States have discretion to use biometric data in automated decision-making processes subject to certain conditions</strong>. According to <strong>Article 11(1) of the LED</strong>, <strong>automated decision-making is prohibited unless authorised by EU or Member States law</strong>, which &ldquo;provides appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller&rdquo;. Particularly when that automated decision-making uses sensitive data including biometric data, the law must provide suitable measures taking into account the nature of that data (Article 11(2), the LED). However, there are <strong>restrictions on conducting biometric surveillance where it involves a profiling process,</strong> which is considered a form of automated decision-making process that evaluates the person&rsquo;s personal aspects pursuant to <strong>Article 3(4)</strong> of the LED. <strong>Article 11(3)</strong> of the LED provides <strong>an unconditional prohibition against conducting profiling that has a discriminatory effect on individuals based on their sensitive data (including biometric data) under EU law</strong>. It is thus important to review the existence of the discriminatory effect of biometric surveillance that involves profiling because according to the LED, national law must introduce a human intervention in this context.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Competent authority under the LED&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Another issue with the deployment of biometric surveillance in public spaces for law enforcement purpose is that the <strong>LED only applies to cases where the data controller is the &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; to process the data for the relevant purpose</strong>. Determining what competent authority means is thus important to understand for example whether, and if so when, a private actor may qualify as an authority as such. Pursuant to Article 3(7)(a) and (b) of the LED, <strong>competent authority is a public authority that is entrusted with the power to prevent, investigate, detect, or prosecute criminal offences, and is any other entity or body that exercises public authority and public powers for the relevant purpose based on national law.</strong> It remains open to discussion whether the latter reference indicates that a private actor must be entrusted by law to process personal data (including biometric data) to process personal data for law enforcement purposes under the LED (Garstka 2018).</p>

<h2>EU Soft law: Convention 108+</h2>
<p>The <strong>Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal data (Convention 108),</strong> which is one of the bases for EU data protection legislation, was updated in 2018. The modernised Convention 108, which is known as <strong>Convention 108+, prohibits the processing of sensitive data (subject to certain conditions),</strong> in a similar, albeit arguably more modest (Greenleaf 2016), way to the GDPR. It lays out similar data subject rights, including the right not to be subjected to a sole automated decision-making process (Article 9). <strong>Although Article 11 of Convention 108+ permits the Signatory Parties to derogate from certain rules</strong> and obligations including the purpose limitation (Article 5(4)) and the duty to inform about data breaches (Article 7(2)) based on national security interests, it expressly requires the need to <strong>establish independent and effective review and supervision of data processing activities in a national security context (Article 11(3)).</strong> While Convention 108+ has yet to be ratified by all EU Member States, it provides a strong standpoint for establishing an oversight mechanism for surveillance measures.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four main positions on RBI systems have emerged among political actors as a result of both technical developments in the field and early legislative activity of EU institutions:&nbsp; 1) active promotion 2) support with safeguards; 3) moratorium and 4) outright ban.</p></li>

<h2>The emergence of remote biometric identification as a policy issue</h2>
<p>The technological developments in the field of remote biometric identification and the early legislative activity of EU institutions have progressively consolidated <strong>four main positions</strong> in relation to Remote Biometric Identification: <strong>1) active promotion 2) support with safeguards; 3) moratorium and 4) outright ban.</strong> In this section we visit each of these positions and detail the logic of the arguments upon which they are based.</p>

<p>As detailed in the introduction, so far, the European Commission and the European Council have generally supported the development of Remote Biometric Identification. In the <em>White Paper on AI</em> he European Commission (2020b) proposes a set of rules and actions for excellence and trust in AI that guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses, while strengthening investment and innovation across EU countries. The Commission&rsquo;s recent draft legislation takes these objectives a step further by proposing to turn Europe into &ldquo;the global hub for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI)&rdquo; (European Commission 2021b). Biometric identification and specifically FRT have been central to many of the AI developments ranging from smart city initiatives financed by the EU all the way to the use of video surveillance and FRTs by law enforcement.</p>

<p>The implementation of the GDPR and the LED in the EU and EEA in May 2018 has set the scene for wide-ranging contestations over the use of surveillance technologies, specifically facial recognition technologies in public spaces. A number of influential reports have been published (FRA 2018; FRA 2019; CNIL 2019b; EDRi 2020; Fernandez et. al. 2020; Gonz&aacute;lez Fuster 2020), online campaigns launched (e.g., #ReclaimYourFace) to warn about the risks posed by AI while simultaneously trying to put pressure on the European Commission to address their impact on safety and fundamental rights. Although many of the issues put forward by these reports reflect the overarching concern with privacy issues and human rights violations, each organisation uses a different problem definition ranging from the technical challenges and limitations of AI all the way to the risks involved in the implementation of biometric technologies. As a consequence they also propose different mitigation strategies such as promotion with safeguards, moratorium or full ban. In what follows, we present the configuration of mobilisation and contestation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Four positions in the policy debates</h2>
<section>
<h3>Active promotion</h3>
<p>A certain number of actors, both at the national and at the local level are pushing for the development and the extension of biometric remote identification. At the local level, the new technological developments meet a growing apetite for smart city initiatives and the ambitions of mayors that strive for developing digital platforms and employ technology-oriented solutions for governance and law enforcement. The intention of the mayor of Nice, Christian Etrosi, to make <strong>Nice a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; of crime prevention, despite repeated concerns of the French DPA,</strong> is a case in point (for a detailed analysis, see chapter 8 in this report, see also Barelli 2018). Law enforcement agencies across Europe also continue to press ahead with efforts to build <strong>digital and automated infrastructures that benefits tech companies who push their face recognition technologies with the concept of smart city and innovation tech</strong> (ex. <a>Huawei</a>, <a>NEC</a>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>At the national level, Biometric systems for the purposes of authentication are increasingly deployed for forensic applications</strong> among law-enforcement agencies in the European Union. As we elaborate in Chapter 3, 11 out of 27 member states of the European Union are already using facial recognition against biometric databases for forensic purposes and 7 additional countries are expected to acquire such capabilities in the near future. The map of the European deployments of Biometric Identification Technologies (see Chapter 3) bear witness to a <strong>broad range of algorithmic processing of security images</strong> in a spectrum that goes from individual, localised authentication systems to generalised law enforcement uses of authentication, to Biometric Mass Surveillance.</p>
<p>Several states that have not yet adopted such technologies seem inclined to follow the trend, and push further. Former Belgian Minister of Interior Pieter De Crem for example, recently declared he was in favour of the use of facial recognition both for judicial inquiries but also for live facial recognition, a much rarer instance.</p>
<section>
<blockquote>"The use of facial recognition can mean increased efficiency for security services [&hellip;] The police are interested in using this technology in several of their missions. First of all, within the framework of the administrative police, with the aim of guaranteeing the security of a closed place accessible to the public, it would allow them to immediately intercept a person who is known in the police databases and who constitutes a danger for public security; but this technology can also be used within the framework of the judicial police, with the aim of controlling, during an investigation, if the suspect was present at the scene of the crime at the time when the punishable act was committed". </blockquote>
<p>Such outspoken advocates of the use of RBI constitute an important voice, but do not find an echo in the EU mainstream discussions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Support with safeguards</h3>
<p>A second category of actors has indeed adopted the point of view that the RBI technologies should be supported, to the condition that their development should be monitored because of the risks they potentially pose. We find in this category the EU Commission, the EU Council, some EU Political parties, as well as the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), national DPAs such as the <a>CNIL</a>, the CoE (Council of Europe), and a certain number of courts.</p>
<p>Developments in the field of AI for governance, security and law enforcement are widely encouraged and financially supported by EU institutions. In their communication <em><strong>Shaping Europe&rsquo;s Digital Futures</strong></em> accompanying the White Paper on AI, the European Commission set out its guidelines and strategies to create a &ldquo;Europe fit for the digital age&rdquo; (European Commission 2020a). In support of a &ldquo;fair and competitive economy&rdquo; the Commission proposes a European Data Strategy (EDS) <strong>to make Europe a global leader in the data-agile economy</strong>. The EDS further aims to ensure Europe&rsquo;s technological sovereignty in a globalised world and &ldquo;<strong>unlock the enormous potential of new technologies like AI&rdquo;</strong> (Newsroom 2020). Therefore, the Commission proposes, among others &ldquo;building and deploying cutting-edge joint digital capacities in the areas of AI, cyber, super and quantum computing, quantum communication and blockchain;&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;[r]einforcing EU governments interoperability strategy to ensure coordination and common standards for secure and borderless public sector data flows and services.&rdquo; (European Commission 2020a, 4)</p>
<p>The financial support for these initiatives is planned to be channelled from the&nbsp;<strong>Digital Europe programme&nbsp;(DEP),&nbsp;the Connecting Europe Facility 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Horizon Europe.</strong> Through the Horizon Europe for instance, the Commission plans to invest &euro;15 billion in the &lsquo;Digital, Industry and Space&rsquo; cluster, with AI as a key activity to be supported. The DEP would benefit from almost &euro;2.5 billion in deploying data platforms and AI applications while also supporting national authorities in making their high value data sets interoperable (Newsroom 2020).</p>
<p>In the <strong>European Parliament</strong>, the EPPEuropean People's Party most aligns with this approach. &ldquo;We want to regulate facial recognition technologies, not ban them. We need clear rules where they can be used and where they must not be used&rdquo;, has for example declared Emil Radev MEP, EPP Group Member of the Legal Affairs Committee. As he puts it &ldquo;Without a doubt, we want to prevent mass surveillance and abuse. But this cannot mean banning facial recognition all together. There are harmless and useful applications for facial recognition, which increase personal security" (European People&rsquo;s Party, 2021)</p>
<p>The <strong>FRA&rsquo;s</strong> 2019 report on facial recognition technologies (FRA 2019), which builds on several previous reports concerning biometrics, IT systems and fundamental rights (FRA 2018); big data and decision making (FRA 2018); data quality and artificial intelligence (FRA 2019); calls for a moderate approach. The FRA advocates for a comprehensive understanding of how exactly facial recognition technologies work and what their impact on fundamental human rights are. Fundamental rights implications of using FRT, they argue, vary considerably depending on the purpose, scope and context. They highlight a number of issues based on the EU fundamental rights framework as well as the EU data protection legislation. For example, according to Article 9 of the GDPR, processing of biometric data is allowed based on the data subject&rsquo;s <strong>explicit</strong> consent, which requires a higher threshold of precision and definitiveness including for processing purposes. In terms of using <strong>biometric surveillance in public spaces</strong>, <strong>explicit consent</strong> would not provide a lawful ground for the relevant data processing because&ndash; as observed by the CJEU in its&nbsp;<em>Schwarz</em>&nbsp;decision, the data subject who is entering the premises <strong>would not have any choice of opting out of data processing</strong>. If the processing of biometric data is based on substantial public interest, which is another lawful data processing ground under Article 9 of the GDPR, it must be &ldquo;<strong>proportionate</strong> to the aim pursued, <strong>respect the essence of the right to data protection</strong> and provide for <strong>suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interest</strong> of the data subjects&rdquo; ((Article 9(2)(g), GDPR). Finally, when emphasising that the processing must be based on a lawful ground as recognised under the EU data protection legislation, the FRA was particularly vocal about the &ldquo;<strong>function creep&rdquo;,</strong> in regard to use of facial recognition systems and emphasised that the purpose of information collection must be strictly determined in light of the gravity of the intrusion upon people&rsquo;s fundamental rights (25).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the FRA places the <strong>right to privacy and protection of personal and sensitive data at the core of their problem definition</strong>, emphasising the potential dangers of FRTs undermining the freedom of expression, association and assembly. The FRA report also makes a case for <strong>the rights of special groups</strong> such as children, the elderly and people with disabilities, and addresses the issue of how the use of FRTs can contribute to further criminalise and stigmatise already discriminated groups of people (e.g., certain ethnic or racial minorities). In light of these considerations they advocate for a clear and &ldquo;sufficiently detailed&rdquo; legal framework, close monitoring and a thorough and continuous impact assessment of each deployment.</p>
<p>The French DPA, the <a>CNIL</a>, takes a similar position in the report &ldquo;Facial Recognition. For a debate living up to the challenges&rdquo; (CNIL 2019b). The <strong><a>CNIL</a></strong> report argues that the contactless and ubiquitous nature of the different FRTs can create an <strong>unprecedented potential for surveillance which</strong>, in the long run, could potentially undermine societal choices.&nbsp; They also emphasise that biometric data is sensitive data therefore its collection is never completely harmless: &ldquo;Even legitimate and well-defined use can, in the event of a cyber-attack or a simple error, have particularly serious consequences. In this context, the question of securing biometric data is crucial and must be an overriding priority in the design of any project of this kind&rdquo; (CNIL 2019b, 6). In their recommendations, while <strong>calling for special vigilance,</strong> they <strong>acknowledge the legitimacy and proportionality of <em>some</em> uses.</strong> The <a>CNIL</a> pointed out that GDPR-endangering applications are often presented as &ldquo;pilot projects&rdquo;, and thus requested the drawing of &ldquo;some <strong>red lines even before any experimental use&rdquo;.</strong> They call instead for &ldquo;a genuinely experimental approach&rdquo; that test and perfect technical solutions that respect the legal framework (CNIL 2019b, 10).</p>
<p>The CoE&rsquo;s <strong>Practical Guide on the Use of Personal Data in the Police Sector</strong> (Council of Europe 2018), supplementing Convention 108+, puts great emphasis on implementing specific safeguards where an automated biometric system is introduced and considers that due to the high risk that such system poses to individuals&rsquo; rights, data protection authorities should be consulted in its implementation (10). Also, as mentioned below, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s <strong>Guidelines on Facial Recognition</strong> (Council of Europe 2021), while considering <strong>a moratorium on the live facial recognition technology,</strong> sets out certain requirements to be met when implementing (possibly forensic) facial recognition technology.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Moratorium</h3>
<p>On 20 January 2021, &nbsp;the <strong>European Parliament</strong> (2021) passed a resolution on artificial intelligence in which they invite the Commission &ldquo;to assess the consequences of a <strong>moratorium on the use of facial recognition systems</strong>, and, depending on the results of this assessment, to consider a moratorium on the use of these systems <strong>in public spaces by public authorities</strong> and in premises meant for <strong>education and healthcare</strong>, as well as on the use of facial recognition systems <strong>by law enforcement authorities in semi-public spaces</strong> such as airports, until the technical standards can be considered fully fundamental rights-compliant, the results derived are non-biased and non-discriminatory, and there are strict safeguards against misuse that ensure the necessity and proportionality of using such technologies;&rdquo; (European Parliament 2021).</p>

<p>Another authority calling for a <strong>moratorium on automated recognition technologies in public spaces</strong> is the European Data Protection Supervisor (<strong>EDPS</strong>), the independent supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring the processing of personal data by the&nbsp;EU institutions and bodies<strong>.</strong> According to their 2020-2024 Strategy (EDPS 2020) &ldquo;Shaping a Safer Digital Future&rdquo; released on 30 June 2020, the EDPS stresses that they are committed to supporting the idea of a moratorium on &ldquo;the deployment, in the EU, of automated recognition in public spaces of human features, <strong>not only of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals</strong>, so that an informed and democratic debate can take place&rdquo; (EDPS 2020).</p>

<p>The EDPS was also among the first to react to the draft <em>Artificial Intelligence Act</em> of the European Commission. While they welcomed the EU&rsquo;s leadership aiming to ensure that AI solutions are shaped according to the EU&rsquo;s values and legal principles, nonetheless they expressed their regret to see that their call for a moratorium on the use of remote biometric identification systems - including facial recognition - in <strong>publicly accessible spaces</strong> had not been addressed by the Commission. A stricter approach is necessary, they argue because &ldquo;remote biometric identification, where AI may contribute to unprecedented developments, presents extremely high risks of deep and non-democratic intrusion into individuals&rsquo; private lives&rdquo; (EDPS 2021). As mentioned below, shortly after their first reaction, the EDPS called for a general ban on the use of remote biometric systems with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) (2021a).</p>
<p>A call for a moratorium, particularly, on facial recognition systems can be found in the Council of Europe documents. The <strong>Guidelines on Facial Recognition</strong> (Council of Europe, 2021) that is one of the instruments supplementing Convention 108+ call for a <strong>moratorium for the live facial recognition technologies (5)</strong> and lay out certain conditions for the use of facial recognition technologies by law enforcement authorities (6). For example, the Guidelines call for <strong>clear parameters and criteria when creating databases such as watchlists</strong> in light of a specific, legitimate, and explicit law enforcement purposes (ibid.)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Outright Ban</h3>
<p>Finally, a certain number of EU Political Parties, EU and national NGOs have argued that there is no acceptable deployment of RBI, because the danger of Biometric Mass Surveillance is too high. Such actors include organisations such as EDRi, <a>La Quadrature du Net</a>, <a>Algorithm Watch</a> or the French D&eacute;fenseur des Droits<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn34" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the European Parliament, the <strong>European Greens</strong> have most vocally promoted the position of the ban, and have gathered support across party lines. In a letter to the European Commission dated 15 April 2021, 40 MEPs from the European Greens, the Party of the European Left, the Party of European Socialists, Renew Europe, a few non-attached MEPs and one member of the far-right party Identity and Democracy expressed their concerns about the leaked EU commission&rsquo; proposal for the AI Regulation a few days earlier. As they argued</p>
<section>
<blockquote>People who constantly feel watched and under surveillance cannot freely and courageously stand up for their rights and for a just society. Surveillance, distrust and fear risk gradually transforming our society into one of uncritical consumers who believe they have &ldquo;nothing to hide&rdquo; and - in a vain attempt to achieve total security - are prepared to give up their liberties. That is not a society worth living in! </blockquote>
<p>Taking in particular issue with Article 4 and the possible exemptions to regulation of AI &ldquo;in order to safeguard public safety&rdquo;, they urge the commissionEuropean Commission &ldquo;to make sure that existing protections are upheld and <strong>a clear ban on biometric mass surveillance in public spaces is proposed</strong>. This is what a majority of citizens want&rdquo; (Breyer et al. 2021)</p>

<p><strong><a>European Digital Rights (EDRi)</a>, an umbrella organisation of</strong> 44 digital rights NGOs in Europe takes a radical stance on the issue. They argue <strong>that mass processing of biometric data in public spaces creates a serious risk of mass surveillance</strong> that infringes on fundamental rights, and therefore they call on the Commission to <strong>permanently stop all deployments that can lead to mass surveillance</strong>. In their report <em>Ban Biometric Mass Surveillance</em> (2020) they demand that the EDPB and national DPAs) <strong>&ldquo;publicly disclose all existing and planned activities and deployments that fall within this remit.</strong>&rdquo; (EDRi 2020, 5). Furthermore, they call for ceasing all planned legislation which establishes biometric processing as well as the funding for all such projects, amounting to an &ldquo;immediate and indefinite ban on biometric processing&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong><a>La Quadrature du Net</a> (LQDN) one of EDRi&rsquo;s founding members</strong> (created in 2008 to &ldquo;promote and defend fundamental freedoms in the digital world") similarly called for a ban on <strong>any present and future use of facial recognition for security and surveillance purposes</strong>. Together with a number of other French NGOs monitoring legislation impacting digital freedoms, as well as other collectives, companies, associations and trade unions, the <a>LQDN</a> initiated a joint open letter in which they call on French authorities to ban any security and surveillance use of facial recognition due to their <strong>uniquely invasive and dehumanising</strong> nature. In their letter they point to the fact that in France there are a &ldquo;multitude of systems already installed, outside of any real legal framework, without transparency or public discussion&rdquo; referring, among others, to the PARAFE system and the use of FRTs by civil and military police. As they put it:</p>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Facial recognition is a uniquely invasive and dehumanising technology, which makes possible, sooner or later, constant surveillance of the public space. It creates a society in which we are all suspects. It turns our face into a tracking device, rather than a signifier of personality, eventually reducing it to a technical object. It enables invisible control. It establishes a permanent and inescapable identification regime. It eliminates anonymity. No argument can justify the deployment of such a technology.&rdquo; </blockquote>
<p>Another prominent voice asking for a full&nbsp;ban on FRTs is the Berlin-based NGO <strong><a>Algorithm Watch</a></strong>. &nbsp;In their report <em><strong>Automating Society (2020)</strong></em> the NGO similarly calls for a ban to all facial recognition technology that might amount to mass surveillance. Their analysis and recommendations place FRTs in a broader discussion regarding <strong>Automated Decision-Making (ADM) systems</strong>. They condemn any use of live facial recognition in public spaces and demand that public uses of FRTs that might amount to mass surveillance be decisively "<strong>banned until further notice, and urgently, at the EU level</strong>&rdquo; (Algorithm Watch 2020, 10).</p>

<p>They further demand <strong>meaningful transparency</strong> that not only means &ldquo;disclosing information about a system&rsquo;s purpose, logic, and creator, as well as the ability to thoroughly analyse, and test a system&rsquo;s inputs and outputs. It also requires <strong>making training data and data results accessible</strong> to independent researchers, journalists, and civil society organisations for public interest research&rdquo; (Algorithm Watch 2020, 11).</p>

<p>Parallel to these reports there are also various campaigns that prove to be effective in raising awareness and putting pressure on governmental bodies both at a national and European level. In May 2020 EDRi launched the <strong>#ReclaimYourFace</strong> campaign, a&nbsp;European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) petition, that calls for a ban on all biometric mass surveillance practices. The campaign centres around the power <strong>imbalances inherent to surveillance</strong>. As of May 2021 the campaign has been supported by more than 50.000 individual signatures. #ReclaimYourFace is not the only campaign, though undoubtedly&nbsp;the most visible and influential, in a European Contextcontext. Other similar international initiatives are: "<strong>Ban the Scan" initiated by Amnesty International, "Ban Automated Recognition of Gender and Sexual Orientation" led by the</strong> international NGO Access Now, or <strong>"Project Panopticon" launched by the Indian based Panoptic Tracker.</strong></p>
<p>In early June; a global coalition was launched under the hashtag <strong>#BanBS consisting of 175 organisations from 55 countries</strong> the<strong>.</strong> The coalition demands the halting of biometric surveillance practices. Drafted by Access Now, Amnesty International, <a>European Digital Rights (EDRi)</a>, Human Rights Watch, Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), and Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do Consumidor (IDEC)), the open letter has been signed by almost 200 organisations, in which they call for an outright ban on uses of facial recognition and biometric technologies that enable mass surveillance and discriminatory targeted surveillance:</p>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;These uses of facial and remote biometric recognition technologies, by design, threaten people&rsquo;s rights and have already caused significant harm. No technical or legal safeguards could ever fully eliminate the threat they pose, and we therefore believe they should never be allowed in public or publicly accessible spaces, either by governments or the private sector.&rdquo; </blockquote>

<h2>EU Commission Proposal on the Regulation for the Artificial Intelligence Act</h2>
<section>
<h3>The EU Commission Proposal</h3>
<p>&nbsp;In April 2021, the European Commission (2021b) published its proposal on the <em>Regulation for the Artificial Intelligence Act</em> with the aim of setting out the harmonised regulatory rules for Member States on AI- based systems. It responded in part to the many challenges posed by the rapid technological development of AI as well as the pressure from watchdogs, regulatory bodies and civil society. If adopted in its current form, the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act will have important implications for the use of biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>On the whole, the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act lays out those rules based on three categories of possible risks that the use of AI may create: <strong>(i) an unacceptable risk</strong> according to which the use of AI is prohibited (Article 5); <strong>(ii) a high-risk AI system</strong>, whose use is subject to certain conditions including an ex-ante conformity assessment (Article 6); and <strong>(iii) low or minimal risk</strong>, whose use is permitted without restrictions.</p>
<p>Notably for the purpose of this report, the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act covers &ldquo;remote biometric identification systems&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;an AI system&nbsp;for the purpose of identifying natural persons at a distance through the comparison of a person&rsquo;s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, and without prior knowledge of the user of the AI system whether the person will be present and can be identified&rdquo; (Article 3(36)). In this way, the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act anticipates covering (AI-based) biometric video surveillance systems. In so doing, it differentiates between the use of &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; and &ldquo;post&rdquo; remote&nbsp;biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement purposes.</p>

<p>On initial observation, the proposal <strong>prohibits</strong> the use of&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;real-time&rdquo; (live) remote&nbsp;biometric identification systems</strong> in public spaces for law enforcement purposes because it classifies them as systems that create an <strong>unacceptable risk</strong>.</p>
<p>However, Article 5 of the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act reads more as a <strong>heavy regulation rather than a prohibition</strong>. This is because the real-time remote biometric identification systems is prohibited unless it is &ldquo;strictly necessary&rdquo; for: <strong>(i) targeted search for specific potential victims of crime</strong>, including missing people; <strong>(ii)&nbsp;the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat</strong> to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; or (<strong>iii) in relation to a criminal offence for which a European Arrest Warrant can be issued provided</strong> that it is punishable by a custodial sentence or detention order of minimum three years. In determining the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems for one of those purposes, Member States should be subject to appropriate limits in time, space, and target person (Article 5(2)). A court or an independent administrative body should authorise the use of this type of biometric identification systems, except in duly justified emergency situations (Article 5(3)). Member States may allow for full or partial use of real-time biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement purposes based on the requirements laid out in Article 5 of the Proposed Regulation (Article 5(4)).</p>

<p><strong>The use of &ldquo;post&rdquo; (forensic) remote identification systems</strong> for law enforcement purposes, on the other hand, is <strong>considered a high-risk AI system</strong> whose developers have the obligation to ensure that the system meets the condition set out in the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Chapter 2 and Annex III). As opposed to other high-risk AI systems whose providers have to conduct internal control checks, the post remote identification systems would be subject to third party conformity assessment.</p>

<p><strong>The above provisions concerning the use of remote biometric identification systems have important implications on the</strong> protection of personal data and privacy as those systems involve processing of personal data. For this reason, they should be read alongside the rules and obligations set out in the GDPR and the LED. When conducted for law enforcement purposes by competent authorities, the remote biometric systems must follow the relevant data protection legislation as well as the ECHR and the Charter requirements since they would involve processing of sensitive personal data.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Reactions to the proposal</h3>
<p>While <strong>data protection authorities</strong> and <strong>civil society</strong> generally welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s initiative praising its horizontal approach and the broad scope of its application, several organisations expressed their concerns that the regulations put forward are often far too lenient and do not do enough to safeguard fundamental rights. The EDPS (2021) for instance voiced its concern that the Commission did not address their <strong>call for a moratorium on the use of biometric identification</strong>, and specifically on <strong>facial recognition systems</strong>. Notably, in their later opinion on the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act with the EDPB (EDPS and EDPB 2021), they called for a general ban on the use of biometric identification (as opposed to their earlier calls on its moratorium). Both institutions were particularly vocal about the high regulation as opposed to the prohibition of the use of real-time remote biometric identification and they observed that the conditions for which the system could be implemented were extensive and would render the so-called prohibition meaningless (11).</p>
<p>They were also very critical of the distinction between real-time and ex-post (forensic) use of biometric identification systems, noting that the latter is as intrusive as the former because of its chilling effect on the freedom of expression, of assembly, of association and the freedom of movement (12). Furthermore, they highlighted the inherently intrusive nature of all types of remote biometric identification systems as they would involve indiscriminate and disproportionate amount of personal data of data subjects in public spaces to identify a few individuals (ibid). This would consequently impact people&rsquo;s reasonable expectation of anonymity in public spaces (ibid). For these reasons, the EDPS and the EDPB called for a general ban on &lsquo;any use of AI for an automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces&rsquo; (ibid).</p>
<p>The EDRi called the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act &ldquo;a glimmer of hope for civil society who have called for red lines on impermissible uses of AI, like facial recognition in public spaces and predictive policing&rdquo;, however, defined the prohibitions proposed as &ldquo;relatively feeble&rdquo;. They criticised in particular the many exemptions in which law enforcement agencies are still allowed to use &ldquo;<strong>real-time remote biometric identification systems</strong>&rdquo; (like facial recognition) in public spaces. These exceptions are <strong>targeted searches for specific potential victims of crime</strong>, to prevent a <strong>threat to life or terrorist attack, or to detect, localise, identify or prosecute a perpetrator or suspect of certain serious crimes</strong> (European Commission 2021b, 22). EDRi also points out that the Act &ldquo;risks giving a green light to governments or public authorities to deploy discriminatory surveillance systems. Its rules for &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; AI &ndash; like predictive policing, AI in asylum procedures and worker surveillance &ndash; fall mainly on the developers themselves, not the public institutions actually deploying them &ndash; a cause for concern.&rdquo; (EDRi 2021)</p>
<p>In <strong>June 2021 EDPB-EDPS also joined civil society in their call for a ban of automated facial recognition technologies</strong> (EDPB 2021a). In their joint opinion on the draft AI regulation (EDPB 2021a), they voice their concern of the exclusion of international law enforcement cooperation from the scope of the AI Proposal. While the EDPB and the EDPS welcome the risk-based approach underpinning the Proposal, they consider the concept of &ldquo;risk to fundamental rights&rdquo; as one which should be aligned with the EU data protection framework and the societal risks for groups of individuals should also be assessed and mitigated. Therefore, they call for &ldquo;<strong>a general ban on any use of AI for automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces, such as recognition of faces, gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals, in any context.&rdquo;</strong> (EDPB 2021a))</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Belgium is one of two European countries that has not yet authorised the use of FRT, however, law enforcement is strongly advocating for its use and the current legal obstacles to its implementation might not hold for very long given the political pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2017, unbeknownst to the Belgian Supervisory Body for Police Information (COC), Brussels International Airport acquired 4 cameras connected to a facial recognition software for use by the airport police. Though the COC subsequently ruled that this use fell outside of the conditions for a lawful deployment, the legality of the airport experiment fell into a legal grey area because of the ways in which the technology was deployed.</p></li>
<li><p>One justification for the legality of the airport experiment from the General Commissioner of <a>Federal Police</a> was to compare the technological deployment to that of the legal use of other intelligent technologies such as Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). Although this argument was rejected at the time, such a system could be re-instated if the grounds for interruption are no longer present in the law.</p></li>
<li><p>Some civil society actors in Belgium contest the legitimacy of remote biometric identification. However, current legislative activity seems to point in the direction of more acceptance for remote biometric surveillance.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>Belgium is, with Spain, one of the few countries in Europe that <strong>has not authorised the use of facial recognition technology</strong>, neither for criminal investigations nor for mass surveillance (Vazquez 2020). This does not mean that it is unlikely to change its position in the very near future. <strong>Law enforcement is indeed strongly advocating its use</strong>, and the current legal obstacles are not likely to hold for very long (Bensalem 2018). The pilot experiment that took place in Zaventem / Brussels International Airport, although aborted, occurred within a national context in which <strong>biometric systems are increasingly used and deployed</strong>.</p>
<p>Belgium will, for example, soon roll out at the national level the new biometric identity card &ldquo;<strong>eID</strong>&rdquo;, the Minister of Interior Annelies Verlinden has recently announced. The identification document, which will rely on the constitution of a broad biometric database and is part of a broader <a>European Union</a> initiative, is developed in partnership with security multinational <strong><a>Thales</a></strong>, was already trialled with 53.000 citizens in (Prins 2021; Thales Group 2020).<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn35" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Municipalities in different parts of the country are experimenting with <strong>Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology</strong>. A smaller number have started deploying &ldquo;<strong>smart CCTV</strong>&rdquo; cameras, which fall just short of using facial recognition technology. The city of Kortrijk has for example <a>deployed</a> &ldquo;<strong>body recognition</strong>&rdquo; technology, which uses walking style or clothing of individuals to track them across the city&rsquo;s CCTV network<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn36" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>36</sup></a>. Facial recognition is possible with these systems, but has not been activated as of yet <strong>pending legal authorisation to do so</strong>. In the city of <a>Roeselare</a>, &ldquo;smart cameras&rdquo; have been installed in one of the shopping streets. Deployed by telecom operator Citymesh, they could provide facial recognition services, but are currently used to count and estimate crowds, data which is shared with the police (van Brakel 2020). All the emerging initiatives of remote biometric identification are however pending a reversal of the decision to halt <a>the experiment at Zaventem Brussels International Airport</a>.</p>
<section>
<h2>The Zaventem pilot in the context of Face Recognition Technology in Belgium</h2>
<p>The use of <strong>facial recognition technology</strong> at the Brussels International Airport was announced on 10 July 2019 in the Flemish weekly <em>Knack</em> by General Commissioner of Federal Police Marc De Mesmaeker (Lippens and Vandersmissen 2019). There is currently no publicly available information as to whom provided the technical system. De Mesmaeker explained that an agreement had been found with the company managing the airport and the labour unions, and thus that the technology was already in use (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3).</p>
<p>As part of the justification for the deployment of FRT in Zaventem, De Mesmaeker made a comparison with <strong>ANPR-enabled cameras</strong>, arguing that &ldquo;They have already helped to solve investigations quickly, (&hellip;). Citizens understand this and have learned to live with their presence, but privacy remains a right&rdquo;. (7sur7 2019)</p>
<p>The <strong>Belgian Supervisory Body for Police Information (COC)</strong><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn37" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>37</sup></a>, in its advisory document, explained that it had no prior knowledge of the deployment and learned about the existence of the facial recognition systems through the interview of De Mesmaeker in the <em>Knack</em> magazine (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3). On 10 July 2019, the COC thus invited the General Commissioner to communicate all the details of the deployment of this technology in the Brussels International Airport. On 18 July 2019, COC received a summary of the system&rsquo;s main components. On 9 August 2019, it subsequently visited the premises of the <a>federal police deployment in Zaventem airport</a> (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3).</p>
<p>We know some technical details about the system through the public information shared by the COC. In early 2017, Brussels airport had acquired <strong>4 cameras connected to a facial recognition software for use by the airport police</strong> (Police A&eacute;ronautique, LPA) (Farge 2020, 15; Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3). The system works in two steps.</p>
<p>When provided with video feeds from the four cameras, the software first creates <strong>snapshots</strong>, generating individual records with the faces that appear in the frame. These snapshots on record are then in a second step compared and potentially matched to previously established &ldquo;<strong>blacklists</strong>&rdquo; created by the police itself (the reference dataset is thus not external to this particular deployment) (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3).</p>
<p>The system did however not live up to its promise and generated a high number of <strong>false positives</strong>. Many features such as skin colour, glasses, moustaches, and beards led to false matches. The system was thus partially disconnected in March 2017, and at the time of the visit of the COC, the system was no longer fully in use (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3). Yet the second step had not been de-activated (matching video feeds against pre-established blacklists of faces), the first function of creating a biometric record of the video feeds was still in place (Organe de Controle de l'Information Polici&egrave;re 2019, 3).</p>

<section>
<h2>Legal bases and challenges</h2>
<p>The legality of the <a>Zaventem airport experiment</a> fell into a legal grey area, but eventually the COC ruled that it fell outside of the conditions for a lawful deployment.</p>
<p>The right to privacy is enshrined in <strong>Article 22 of the Belgian Constitution</strong>, which reads as &ldquo;everyone has the right to the respect of his private and family life, except in the cases and conditions determined by the law.&rdquo; The <strong>ECHR</strong> and the case law of the <strong>ECtHR</strong> have had considerable influence over the interpretation of Article 22 of the Belgian Constitution (Lavrysen et al. 2017) and thus the right enshrined therein can be broadly construed to encompass the right to protection of personal data and to address risks associated with the use of new technologies (Kindt et al. 2008; De Hert 2017). <strong>Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter</strong> are also relevant where the legislator acts within the scope of EU law (Cour constitutionnelle, N&deg; 2/2021, 14 January 2021).</p>
<p>Belgium adapted its data protection law to the GDPR by enacting the <strong>Act of 30 July 2018</strong> on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal data (the Data Protection Act). The same act implements the LED, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regard to processing of sensitive data for non-law enforcement purposes, the Act sets out certain processing activities which would be regarded as necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, which is one of the lawful grounds listed in <strong>Article 9 of the GDPR</strong> to process said data. Overall, the relevant public interest purposes relate to processing by human rights organisations in relation to their objective of defending and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in relation to an offence in relation to missing persons or sexual exploitation (Article 8,&nbsp;&sect;1, the Data Protection Act). A separate data processing purpose for <strong>personal data of sexual life of the data subject</strong> is introduced in relation to the statutory purpose of evaluating, supervising, and treating&nbsp;persons whose sexual behaviour may be qualified as a criminal offence&nbsp;(Article 8, &sect;1, 3&deg;, the Data&nbsp;Protection Act).</p>
<p><strong>Biometric data, however, cannot be processed</strong> by the respective associations for said public interest purpose unless specified in legal provisions (<strong>Article 8, &sect;1, the Data&nbsp;Protection Act)</strong>. More importantly <strong>when biometric data is processed</strong> (not limited to the reasons of public interest), <strong>there must be additional safeguards</strong> whereby the data controller designates the categories of people who have access to the data, keeps a record of people who have access to the data for the data protection authority, and makes sure that they are bound by a legal, statutory or contractual obligation of confidentiality with respect to the personal data that they process (Article 9, the Data Protection Act).</p>
<p>The Act further provides a number of lawful bases for which sensitive data may be processed for law enforcement purposes as specified in <strong>Article 10 of the GDPR</strong>. The legal bases include processing as authorised by law, decree, ordinance, EU law or international agreement, necessary for protecting the vital interests of the data subject or another, in relation to data that is made public&nbsp;(Article 34, the Data Protection Act). Competent authorities have the same obligations of compiling a list of persons who have access to the data and are bound by obligations of confidentiality (Article 34,&nbsp;&sect;2, the Data Protection Act).</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 23 of the GDPR, the Act provides exceptions to the data subject&rsquo;s rights when personal data are processed by a range of authorities specified therein including the police services (Title I, Chapter III, the Data Protection Act) and intelligence and security services (Title III, the Data Protection Act). Particularly in the context of data processing for law enforcement purposes, pursuant to Article 35 of the Act, the sole automated decision making is permitted if the law, the decree, the ordinance, the EU legislation, or the international agreement provides for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, including at least the right to human intervention on the part of the controller. However, profiling that leads to discrimination based on the sensitive data is prohibited (Article 35, the Data Protection Act).</p>
<p>In March 2018, Belgium amended&nbsp;its law on the use of surveillance cameras, particularly the <strong>Police Act (<em>Loi sur la fonction de police</em>/<em>Wet op het politieambt</em>)</strong>&nbsp;to regulate the use of cameras by the police. Accordingly, it provided new rules on the use of mobile cameras&nbsp;<em>(cam&eacute;ra mobile</em>/<em>mobiele camera</em>) and smart cameras (<em>cam&eacute;ra intelligente</em>/<em>intelligente camera</em>) equipped with additional technology that is beyond simple processing of images such as <strong>facial recognition cameras</strong> or <strong>automatic number plate recognition</strong>, as acknowledged in the Parliamentary Document No. 54 2855/001 of 4 January.&nbsp;<strong>The amendment to the Act permits the use of real-time smart cameras by the police in carrying out their administrative and judicial duties</strong> (subject to when they are to be used in public, in enclosed places freely accessible by the public or not). According to the amended Act, the personal data collected by cameras can be retained for a maximum period of 12 months (Article 25/5, Police Act). During this period, access to the data is allowed for a period of one month from their registration and subject to a written and&nbsp;reasoned decision of the public prosecutor (<em>Procureur du roi/Procureur des Konings</em>) (Article 25/6, Police Act). When cameras are used visibly in administrative as well as judicial missions of the police (e.g., maintaining public order, crowd management etc.) (ibid), they should not be aimed at collecting information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, political views, trade union membership, health status, sex life or sexual orientation (Article&nbsp;25/3, &sect;3, Police Act). Interestingly, biometric data is not included in this list of information whose collection by means of cameras are prohibited. The Police Act further sets out the police powers to collect information about people and it provides that biometric data that categorises different data subjects such as those who committed an offence against maintaining public order or for whom there is a monitoring order can be processed solely for the identification of those subjects (Article 44/1, the Police Act). If such processing is likely to generate a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, the police must consult the Belgian Supervisory Body for Police Information (ibid).</p>

<h2>Mobilisations and contestations </h2>
<p>Based on this legislative framework, the General Commissioner, in his letter to the COC dated 18 July 2019, justified a deployment without consultation of the COC nor the Belgian DPA on the grounds that</p>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;although the creation of a technical database for facial recognition is not possible under the current legislation, the use of real-time intelligent technologies other than Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is possible under Article 25/3 of the LFP. The legislator has indeed provided that a camera used by the police, regardless of its type, can be equipped with intelligent technology. The introduction of real-time facial recognition is therefore, in our opinion, in accordance with the law.&rdquo; </blockquote>
<p>The COC was not convinced by the arguments of the General Commissioner and concluded that the LFP did not apply. It justified its decision as follows:</p>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;As the case stands, the Regulator is not entirely convinced that the LFP is applicable. It is true that the definition of a "smart camera" is taken in a very broad sense. According to Article 25/2, &sect;1, 3&deg; of the LFP, this term refers to "a camera which also includes components and software which, whether or not coupled with registers or files, can process the images collected autonomously or not". In the explanatory memorandum, ANPR cameras and cameras for facial recognition are mentioned as examples </blockquote>
<p>It further added that</p>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>The possibility of testing a facial recognition system first raises questions about the exact scope of the processing. When determining the correct legal framework, it is not possible to establish from the outset whether the processing of personal data in the context of research and prosecution is already being considered in the test environment or during a test period - and thus whether the FPA and Title II of the DPA apply. The answer to this question is crucial in order to determine the legal basis, the level of decision making within the police that is entitled to decide to use facial recognition, the nature of the storage medium and the duration of storage, and the level of information security to be observed (operational or not). Secondly, and in the alternative, the Review Body notes that the LFP, if applicable, does describe what falls under the definition of a smart camera, but does not stipulate in what circumstances and under what conditions the use of facial recognition cameras is permitted, let alone on what medium the images can/should be recorded and what data should at least be stored. In the current state of the legislation, the legislator only wanted to regulate the creation of a technical database for ANPR images. </blockquote>
<p>The COC thus counter-argued that because the current CCTV law was not voted on with facial recognition but ANPR in mind, and facial recognition is permitted but only for commercial use (such as the check-in of passengers) <strong>it was thus not legal to set up a technical database</strong> containing <strong>biometric information</strong> and the system did therefore not have a sound legal basis (7sur7 2019). The interesting technicality of the case is that <strong>the &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;</strong> generated in the first phase of the system&rsquo;s workflow were in practice stored only for a fraction of a second. Yet according to the law, this is still a biometric database, and thus not allowed (L'Avenir 2019).</p>
<p>The reaction by the Belgian Supervisory Body for Police Information shows that a degree of unclarity on the legal basis for conducting biometric surveillance persists. From a legislative perspective, <strong>such a system can easily be re-activated</strong> if the grounds for the interruption are not present in the law anymore. The current legislative activity seems to point in this direction.</p>

<h2>Effects of the technologies</h2>
<p>While the city of Brussels is the location of much EU-level activism, this hasn&rsquo;t translated yet in an equal mobilisation at the national level &ndash; perhaps due to the currently very restrictive legislative position on the matter and the institutional checks and balances described in this chapter &ndash; banning de facto the use of such technologies.</p>
<p>The French campaign Technopolice has extended to Belgium and is raising awareness through a diversified strategy based on public forums, cartography of technology and organization of events. The NGO <strong>Ligue des Droits Humains</strong> is a member of the <strong>Reclaim Your Face</strong> campaign, along with 40 other organisations<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn38" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>38</sup></a>, yet it hasn&rsquo;t been as active as partner organizations in neighbouring France or Germany.</p>

<li><p>The <a>Fieldlab Burglary Free Neighbourhood</a> is a public-private collaboration with two aims: to detect suspicious behaviour and to influence the behaviour of the suspect.

<li><p>From a legal perspective, there is a question as to whether or not the data processed by the Burglary Free Neighbourhood programme qualifies as personal data and thus would fall within the scope of data protection legislation.</p></li>
<li><p>It is contested whether forms of digital monitoring and signalling are actually the most efficient methods for preventing break ins. Despite the aims of the programme, to date, the streetlights have only been used to capture data for the purposes of machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p>The infrastructure installed for the experiments can potentially be used for more invasive forms of monitoring. During the project, local police, for example, already voiced an interest in access to the cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>In March 2021, the Fieldlab trial ended. The data collected over the course of the project was not sufficient enough to have the computer distinguish suspicious trajectories. The infrastructure of cameras and microphones is currently disabled, yet remains in place.</p></li>

<p>In October 2019, the Carlo Collodihof, a courtyard in the Rotterdam neighbourhood Lombardijen, was equipped with a new kind of streetlamp. The twelve new luminaires did not just illuminate the streets; they were <strong>fitted with cameras, microphones, speakers, and a computer which was connected to the internet</strong>. They are part of the so called <strong><a>Fieldlab Burglary Free Neighbourhood</a></strong>: an experiment in the public space with technologies for computer sensing and data processing, aimed at the prevention of break-ins, robberies, and aggression; increasing the chances of catching and increasing a sense of safety for the inhabitants of the neighbourhood ((Redactie Inbraakvrije Wijk 2019; Kokkeler et al. 2020b). The practical nature of a Fieldlab provides a way to examine concretely how the various technologies come together, and how they fit in with existing infrastructures and regulations.</p>
<section>
<h2>Detection and decision-making in the &ldquo;Burglary free neighbourhood&rdquo; Fieldlab</h2>
<p>The national programme Burglary Free Neighbourhood was initiated and funded by the <strong>Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security</strong>. It is led by <strong><a>DITSS</a></strong> (Dutch Institute for Technology, Safety &amp; Security), a non-profit organisation, that has been involved in earlier computer sensing projects in the Netherlands &ndash; for example in <strong><a>Stratumseind</a>, Eindhoven</strong> (The Hague Security Delta 2021). Other parties involved include the <a>municipality of Rotterdam</a>, the <a>police</a> &ndash;both on a local and national level&ndash; the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and insurance company <a>Interpolis</a>. Part of the research is carried out by <a>University of Twente</a>, <a>Avans Hogeschool</a>, the Network Institute of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the <a>Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law</a> (Freiburg, Germany).</p>

<p>Figure 2. Fieldlab in Rotterdam Lombardijen</p>
<p>From a technological perspective, the project has two aims: to <strong>detect suspicious behaviour</strong>, and in turn<strong>, to influence the behaviour of the suspect</strong>. As such, project manager Guido Delver, who agreed to be interviewed for this report, describes the project as being primarily a behavioural experiment (Delver 2021). The twelve luminaires are provided by <a>Sustainder</a> (their Anne series (Sustainder 2021)). The processing of the video and audio is done on the spot by a computer embedded in the luminaire, using software from the Eindhoven based company <strong><a>ViNotion</a></strong> (ViNotion 2020). This software reads the video frames from the camera and estimates the presence and position of people &ndash; thereby mapping the coordinates of the video frame to coordinates in the space. It then determines the direction they are facing. <strong>Only these values &ndash;position and direction&ndash; and no other characteristics nor any images,</strong> are sent over the internet to a datacentre somewhere in the Netherlands, where the position data is stored for further processing (Delver 2021).</p>
<p>Currently, <strong>there is no immediate processing of the position data</strong> to classify behaviour as being suspicious or not. The proposed pipeline consists of two stages: first, an unsupervised machine algorithm for <strong>anomaly (outlier) detection processes the gathered trajectories</strong>, in order to distinguish trajectories that statistically deviate from the norm. As an example, both children playing, as well as burglars making a scouting round through the neighbourhood can potentially produce anomalous trajectories. Secondly, <strong>these anomalous trajectories are judged as being suspicious or not by a computer model</strong> that was trained with human supervision. In the Fieldlab&rsquo;s first data collection experiment 100.000 trajectories were collected, totalling 20.000.000 data points (Hamada 2020). It turned out however that this was still too few to draw any conclusions about viability of the approach; the big data was still too small (Delver 2021).</p>
<p>Another input for detecting suspicious situations is the <strong>microphone with which some of the streetlamps are equipped</strong>. By recording two frequencies of sound, sounds can be categorised as coming from for example a conversation, shouting, dog barking, or the breaking of glass. The two frequencies recorded provide too little information to distinguish the words in a conversation (Delver 2021).</p>
<p>Aside from experimenting with the automated detection of suspicious behaviour, the Fieldlab experiments with various ways in which the detected situations can be played out. Project manager Guido Delver notes that the aim is not <em>per se</em> to involve the police. Instead, the suspect should be deterred before any crime is committed (Delver 2021). Various strategies are laid out: the yet-to-be-autonomous system can <strong>voice warnings through the speakers</strong> embedded in the streetlamps. Or, in line with the work of DITSS in Eindhoven&rsquo;s Stratumseind street, the <strong>light intensity or colour of the streetlamps can be changed</strong> (Intelligent Lighting Institute, n.d.). Both strategies are aimed at signalling the subjects that their behaviour is noticed, which generally suffices to have burglars break off their scouting. Another option under consideration is to send a signal to the residents living nearby.</p>
<p>The process of data gathering in the Burglary Free Neighbourhood is quite similar to technologies that are deployed for anonymous people counting. One such application has been developed by <strong><a>Numina</a></strong> and is <a>deployed in the Dutch city of Nijmegen</a>: individuals are <strong>traced through space and time, but not identified or categorised.</strong> This information is then used to provide statistics about the number of visitors in the city centre (Schouten and Bril 2019). Another Dutch deployment of technologically similar software is the <strong><a>One-and-a-half-meter monitor</a> developed by the <a>municipality of Amsterdam</a>,</strong> which is based on the YOLO5 object detection algorithm and trained on the COCO dataset. This data processing architecture can detect the presence of persons but is incapable of deducing any characteristics (Amsterdam-Amstelland safety region 2020). These implementations show biometrics can be used to detect the presence of people, while refraining from storing these characteristics.</p>

<h2>Legal bases and challenges</h2>
<p>The <a>Fieldlab Burglary Free Neighbourhood</a> programme shows how data can be used to <strong>conduct monitoring</strong> and <strong>nudging of individuals&rsquo; behaviours</strong>. From a legal point of view, the question is whether the data processed in the context of the programme qualifies as <strong>personal data</strong> and would thus fall within <strong>the scope of data protection legislation</strong>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Constitution&nbsp;for the Kingdom of&nbsp;the Netherlands&nbsp;provides for a general right to protection for&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;in Article 10, according to which restrictions to that right must be laid down by law. The GDPR Implementation Act (<em>Uitvoeringswet Algemene Verordening Gegevens-bescherming</em>) (UAVG), as well as the Police Data Act (<em>Wet Politiegegevens</em>) or the Judicial Data and Criminal Records Act (<em>Wet Justitiele en Strafvorderlijke Gegevens</em>) which implement the GDPR and the LED, provides the legal framework regarding privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>The <strong>definition of personal data</strong> as enshrined in the GDPR and the LED is directly applicable under the Dutch law. To qualify data as such, &ldquo;any information&rdquo; must relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. Based on the data that can be captured by the Fieldlab programme, two elements of this definition need further attention.</p>
<p><strong>-&ldquo;Information &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; a natural person&rdquo;</strong>. The former <strong>Article 29 Working Party</strong> (2007) substantiated this element by noting that information can relate to an individual based on its content (i.e., information is about the individual), its purpose (i.e., information is used or likely to be used to evaluate, treat in a way, or influence the status or behaviour of an individual), or its result (i.e., information&nbsp;is likely to have an impact on a certain person&rsquo;s rights and interests, taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the precise case). These three alternative notions to determine whether the information relates to an individual was endorsed by the <strong>CJEU</strong> in its&nbsp;<em>Nowak</em>&nbsp;decision (C-434/16), where it dealt with the purpose (i.e., it evaluates the candidate&rsquo;s competence) and the result (i.e., it is used to determine whether the candidate passes or fails, which can have an impact on the candidate&rsquo;s rights) of the information in question in determining whether the written answers to an exam would qualify as personal data. In brief, in determining whether the data captured by the Fieldlab programme qualify as personal data, the context for which the data is used or captured is important. Information about the level of crowding or sound could &ldquo;relate&rdquo; to an individual if it is used to evaluate or influence the behaviour of a person (based on its purpose), or to affect a person&rsquo;s rights (based on its result) (Gali&#269;&nbsp;and Gellert 2021).</p>

<p><strong>-&ldquo;Identifiable Person&rdquo;.</strong>&nbsp;The notion of identifiability covers circumstances where it is possible to distinguish the individual from a group of people by combining additional information (See 4.2.1). In situations where the person cannot be identified, determining the extent to which that person can be identifiable depends on the possibilities of combining additional identifying information (Gali&#269;&nbsp;and Gellert 2021). However, where the system mainly operates on <strong>non-personal data because its aim is to influence the behaviour of a group of people</strong>, instead of an identified or identifiable person, the chances of having sufficient data to render the person identifiable would be lower (ibid).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uncertainties around these two elements of personal data mean that <strong>a project that monitors and tracks the behaviour of individuals in public spaces may fall outside the scope of data protection legislation</strong> if there are uncertainties around whether the data it processes actually qualify as personal data. Notably, the Whitepaper on the sensors in the role of municipalities (van Barneveld, Crover, and Yeh 2018), produced in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, a reference to the definition of personal data and the possibility of combining for example sound-data with camera recordings to trigger the application of the data protection legislation, without giving further details. Unlike in the relevant sections of the other case studies, this section will not explore further data processing conditions under the UAVG and the other relevant laws because the issue from a data protection view in the first instance with the Fieldlab programme or any similar initiative is whether they process personal data.</p>

<p>Despite visits from the mayor of Rotterdam and Secretary of State Sander Dekker, the <strong>Fieldlab of the Burglary Free Neighbourhood</strong> <strong>has not been discussed much in Dutch media</strong>. The most prominent discussion on the project has been in a TV broadcast and online video by Nieuwsuur, in which criminologist Marc Schuilenburg is sceptical about the technology deployed in the Fieldlab (Nieuwsuur 2020a, 5:38m):</p>
<section>
<blockquote>So far, there has not been any study that assesses the effectiveness of the streetlamps. We know what works best against burglary: looking out for each other and fitting your door with a double lock. Social cohesion is known to work best. [&hellip;] What is happening now is that social cohesion is degrading, because neighbours can trust in the intelligent streetlight. Any responsibility is delegated to a streetlight.</blockquote>
<p>Schuilenburg frames the interest of cities in technologies such as those used in the Burglary Free Neighbourhood as being part <strong>of the well-marketed narrative of the &ldquo;smart city&rdquo; that is sold by technology companies</strong>: &ldquo;no city wants to be dumb&rdquo; (&ldquo;Nieuwsuur&rdquo; 2020b, 36m). To some extent, Guido Delver positions the project&rsquo;s <strong>privacy-by-design methodology</strong> <strong>in contrast to many of these commercial products for surveillance</strong>. In his conversations with various municipalities he recognises, and shares, the interest for &ldquo;smart&rdquo; surveillance technologies. However, Delver attempts to minimise the data gathering in the Burglary Free Neighbourhood. This proves to be a constant negotiation, for example the police have voiced an interest in access to the camera feeds in case suspicious behaviour was detected. However, access to the camera feeds has been deliberately kept outside of the scope of the project (Delver 2021).</p>
<p>While the project currently only stores the position of passers-by, there are also <strong>technical considerations for the capture of more information.</strong> For example, the video cameras cannot cover the entire area, therefore, as no characteristics of individuals are stored, <strong>tracking people from one camera to the next is problematic</strong>. It raises the question of whether biometric measurements such as a person&rsquo;s estimated volume, length, or colour of clothing should be recorded, this would allow the computer to link the trace of one camera to another. Posing ethical and legal questions for the project: <strong>what are the legal ramifications of deducing and (temporarily) storing these characteristics, and for how long should they be stored (Delver 2021)?</strong> Even for projects that decide to consider privacy by design, it can be tempting to store and process biometric information. However, as mentioned above (see section 7.2.), the challenges in determining whether the Fieldlab or any other similar initiatives process personal data as defined in the GDPR raises questions on the extent to which these programmes fall within the scope of the data protection legislation, irrespective of the fact that they may be designed to affect the personal autonomy of individuals (as opposed to an identified or identifiable individual) by influencing and nudging their behaviours.</p>
<p>Finally, commentators have pointed out the <strong>discrepancy between what is expected of the technology, and what it is actually doing.</strong> For example, the Algemeen Dagblad (Krol 2019) writes that the &ldquo;smart streetlights&rdquo; are actually able to &ldquo;recognise behaviour&rdquo; and to &ldquo;sound the alarm&rdquo; if necessary. <strong>Whereas up until now, the streetlights have only been used to capture data for machine learning.</strong></p>
<p>These observations raise the question as to whether or not the communication about the technologies used suffices. When entering the neighbourhood, a sign signals to the visitor that the Fieldlab is operative, however, much of the information discussed above could not be found on the website that is mentioned on the sign &ndash; as is indicated by the breath of references used. This situation is substantially different from the way that, for example, the <a>city of Amsterdam</a> lays out its use of algorithms: one website presents the goals of the projects, the kinds of data processing that is happening, the datasets on which the algorithms are trained, and in some cases the source code is shared (Amsterdam Algoritmeregister, 2021). <strong>The Dutch government is currently drafting regulations for a national register of cameras and sensors as deployed by municipalities (Nieuwsuur 2020b).</strong></p>

<h2>Effects of the technologies</h2>
<p>Since March 2021, the experiment in the Fieldlab of the Burglary Free Neighbourhood in Rotterdam has been on hold. <strong>Researchers have not yet been able to have the computer distinguish suspicious trajectories or sounds.</strong> As such, the system has not been able to respond to any such situations with lights or sounds (Redactie LikeJeWijk 2021). Further research into this is happening in a Virtual Reality environment, as was discussed in the first section.</p>
<p>As part of the Fieldlab, research about the effects of the technologies deployed in the streets has been carried out by the <a>Avans Hogeschool</a>, presenting five relevant observations. First, it is too early to draw any conclusions about the impact of the deployed technologies on the statistics for high impact crime (e.g., break-ins, aggression, robberies) in the neighbourhood (Kokkeler et al. 2020b, 25). Moreover, no research has yet been done into the waterbed effect of crime &ndash; whether crime prevention in one block, leads to an increase in crime in an adjacent neighbourhood (Kokkeler et al. 2020b, 9).</p>
<p>Secondly, in the Rotterdam neighbourhood that was examined, the streetlights equipped with cameras were by no means the only technological interventions to prevent break-ins. A breadth of technology is deployed &ndash;e.g.,&nbsp;cameras, alarm systems&ndash; which are either privately owned, owned by the municipality, the police, or distributed by insurance companies. In this cacophony of technological appliances, <strong>it becomes unclear which data is collected and how it is processed.</strong> Furthermore, it is unclear <strong>who owns and manages these data collection and processing networks, whether they are private parties or law enforcement agencies</strong>. Kokkeler et al.&nbsp;argue that a better overview of these practices is crucial in order to assess the ethical, legal, and social impact of these deployments (Kokkeler et al. 2020b, 24).</p>
<p>Thirdly, after conducting interviews with the residents, Kokkeler et al.&nbsp;concluded that most were unaware that the newly placed streetlights were equipped with sensors. <strong>Moreover, when discussing the &ldquo;sensors&rdquo; in the streetlights, many residents could only imagine the use of cameras &ndash; not realising what data was being gathered (Kokkeler et al. 2020a, 21).</strong> While resident participation features prominent in the goals of the Fieldlab, the Coronavirus pandemic has hindered the planned involvement of the residents (Delver 2021).</p>
<p>Fourth, the moment residents were informed about the data gathering and processing taking place, they were optimistic about a potential use of the data by the local police and municipality. As long as the cameras <strong>were only directed at public space</strong>. Some residents voiced their concern that the information should only be used to address high impact crime, and not for minor offences &ndash; in particular if these involve minors. On the other hand, some other residents suggested a broader use of the streetlights, for example in fighting litter and speeding (Kokkeler et al. 2020a, 21). Despite the fact that the direct sharing of the generated data with the police is contrary to the aims of the project (Delver 2021) the infrastructure that is deployed in the streets enables other engagements with the technology &ndash; the so-called <strong>function creep</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, the residents of the Rotterdam neighbourhood are known to not properly use more &ldquo;low-tech&rdquo; security measures. A case in which someone went out to walk their dog while leaving the key in the door is an illustration of this. Moreover, when a break in happens, it is not always reported, as often the culprit is directly or indirectly known (Kokkeler et al. 2020a, 22). This indicates that the technologies used in the Fieldlab <strong>might be unfit to address the primary issues in the neighbourhood</strong>.</p>
<p>All in all, the case of the Fieldlab Burglary Free Neighbourhood provides for interesting and relevant research into <strong>alternative means of behavioural monitoring and influencing</strong>. The direct &ldquo;nudging&rdquo; of behaviour theoretically removes the need for a centralised database of biometric data, it also does not capture and process biometric information on individuals. Yet in order to increase detection capabilities, it can be a <strong>slippery slope to implement algorithmic deduction of individuals&rsquo; traits</strong>, while storing these for short amounts of time. However, for how long should this information be kept? In other words: <strong>what is the desired balance between increased detection performance and storage duration</strong>. In this light, the project&rsquo;s current setup of not storing, nor deducing any biometric information is a clear, fixed, guideline that avoids this grey zone and many of the issues with remote biometric identification that are addressed within this report.</p>
<p>It is however apparent that projects such as these <strong>require (legal) fail-safes for their usage</strong>. In the case of the <strong>Burglary Free Neighbourhood</strong>, it seems the <strong>project&rsquo;s privacy-by-design has been secured by project manager Delvers</strong>. The fact that local police requested access to the cameras indicates the necessity for proper oversight in such deployments. Assuming that the data protection legislation applies to the <strong>Fieldlab</strong> or any similar initiatives (to the extent that they process &ldquo;personal data&rdquo;), it is unclear as to who processes which type of data and the level of collaboration between the private and public sectors. This uncertainty means that it may be <strong>hard to allocate responsibilities and obligations</strong> under the data protection legislation since it may be complicated to determine who is the &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo;, whose processing activities in a law enforcement context fall under the <strong>scope of the LED</strong>, as well as who is the <strong>authority responsible for processing personal data</strong> (i.e., the <strong>data controller</strong>) and the one responsible for processing the data on behalf of that authority (i.e., the <strong>data processor</strong>). Such uncertainties may complicate the effectiveness of the <strong>data protection legislation</strong> (Purtova, 2018).</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Several French cities have launched &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; projects involving biometric technologies, however Nice is arguably the national leader. The city currently has the highest CCTV coverage of any city in France and has more than double the police agents per capita of the neighbouring city of Marseille.</p></li>
<li><p>Through a series of public-private partnerships the city began a number of initiatives using RBI technologies (including emotion and facial recognition). These technologies were deployed for both authentication and surveillance purposes with some falling into the category of biometric mass surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>One project which used FRT at a <a>high school in Nice</a> and <a>one in Marseille</a> was eventually declared unlawful. The court determined that the required consent could not be obtained due to the power imbalance between the targeted public (students) and the public authority (public educational establishment). This case highlights important issues about the deployment of biometric technologies in public spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of biometric mass surveillance by the mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi has put him on a collision course with the French Data Protection Authority (<a>CNIL</a>) as well as human rights/ digital rights organisations (<a>Ligue des Droits de l&rsquo;Homme</a>, <a>La Quadrature du Net</a>). His activities have raised both concern and criticism over the usage of the technologies and their potential impact on the privacy of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>Although several French cities such as Paris, <a>Valenciennes</a> or <a>Marseille</a>&nbsp;have launched pilot projects for &ldquo;safe city&rdquo; projects involving <strong>biometric technologies (facial, voice, sound recognition),</strong> the city of Nice is perhaps the <strong>national leader in the experimentation with such technologies at a local level</strong> (Nice Premium 2017). The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi (Les R&eacute;publicains Party, right) a prominent political figure on the national political scene, has made clear his intention was to make Nice a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; of crime prevention (Barelli 2018). Since 2010, more than <strong>1.962 surveillance cameras have been deployed throughout the city</strong>, making it the city with <strong>highest CCTV coverage in France</strong> (27 cameras per square meter). Nice also possesses the most local police in France per inhabitant: 414 agents, for a population of 340.000 (in comparison, the neighbouring city of Marseille has 450 agents for 861.000 inhabitants).</p>
<section>
<h2>The various facets of the &ldquo;Safe city&rdquo; project in Nice</h2>
<p>Nice has experimented with various initiatives related to <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> &ndash; many of which fall into the category of biometric mass surveillance. In 2017, Christian Estrosi announced a partnership with the energy company <a>Engie Ineo</a> for the development of an Urban Surveillance Centre (Centre de Surveillance Urbain, CSU). Based on a touch-interface technology, it centralises a platform of <strong>real-time data such as traffic accidents, patrol locations, as well as video feeds from CCTV</strong>s on the streets and in public transportation. (Dudebout 2020, 1). The video feeds from the city tramways are connected to an <strong><a>emotion recognition algorithm</a></strong> to flag suspicious situations (Allix 2018).</p>
<p>In June 2018, an additional step was taken with the signing of a partnership agreement with a consortium of companies headed by <a>Thales</a>, specialised in social network intelligence, geolocation, biometrics and crowd simulation<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn39" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>39</sup></a> for a <strong>&ldquo;Safe City&rdquo; project</strong> (Dudebout 2020, 2). Established for three years (2018-2021) with a budget of EUR 10,9 million, the project is financed by the city council, subsidised in part by <a>BPI France</a><a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn40" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>40</sup></a>, and supported by the Committee for the Security Industrial Sector, an agency under the tutelage of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn41" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>41</sup></a> (Allix 2018; BPI France 2018)</p>
<p>The first facial recognition test of the Safe city project took place from 16 February to 2 March 2019, during the Nice Carnival. The experiment was a simulation, involving matching faces collected through CCTV footage of the crowd attending the carnival with a fictitious set of databases (lost individuals, wanted individuals, or individuals with restraining orders). The fictitious datasets were constituted by 50 volunteers, recruited mostly among the municipality, who provided their pictures, or were freshly photographed for the test. The system used <strong>live facial recognition software provided by the company Anyvision</strong>. The live feeds were filmed during the carnival. Passers-by (approximately 1000 people were concerned) were informed of the ongoing test and asked to wear a bracelet if they consented to being filmed (Hassani 2019).</p>
<p>A second experiment took the form of a <strong>software application (app) named &ldquo;Reporty&rdquo;,</strong> rolled out in January 2018. The app, developed by the Israeli American company <a>Carbyne</a>, allows citizens to be in direct audio and video connection and share geolocation information with the Urban Supervision Centre in order to report any incivility, offense, or crime that they might witness (Barelli 2018).</p>
<p>The third project, involving <strong>facial recognition</strong> was tested in the education context. In February 2019, <strong><a>a high school in Nice</a> and <a>a high school in Marseille</a> were fitted with facial recognition technology</strong> at their gates in order to grant or bar access to the premises. The official motivation behind the deployment was to "assist the personnel of the high schools and to fight against identity theft&rsquo;&rsquo; (Dudebout 2020, 3&ndash;4).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Legal bases and challenges</h2>
<p>The use of facial recognition systems in high schools in Nice and Marseille, which <strong>was declared unlawful by the Administrative Court of Marseille</strong>, raised important issues on the legality of deploying biometric technologies in public places.</p>
<p>There is no specific provision devoted to the right to privacy or data protection in the French Constitution of 1958, but constitutional safeguards for the interests protected under said rights exists. <strong>The French Constitutional Council</strong> (<em><a>Conseil Constitutionnel</a></em>) has recognised that the respect for privacy is protected by Article 2 of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which is incorporated in the <strong>French constitutionality bloc</strong> <strong>as binding constitutional rule (bloc de constitutionnalit&eacute;)</strong> (French Constitutional Council, Decision N&deg; 2004-492 DC of 2 March 2004). Accordingly, the collection, retention, use and sharing of personal data attracts protection <strong>under the right to privacy</strong> (French Constitutional Council, Decision n&deg; 2012-652 DC of 22 March 2012). The limitations to that right must thus be justified on grounds of general interest and implemented in an adequate manner, <strong>proportionate to this objective&nbsp;(ibid).</strong></p>

<p><strong>France has updated the Act N&deg;78-17</strong> of 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties in various stages to incorporate the provisions of the <strong>GDPR</strong>, address the possible exemptions contained in the <strong>GDPR</strong>, and implement the <strong>LED</strong>.</p>

<p>The Act sets out the <strong>reserved framework for sensitive data including biometric data</strong> in its Article 6, which states that <strong>sensitive data</strong> can be processed for purposes listed in Article 9(2) of the GDPR as well as those listed in its Article 44. The latter includes the <strong>re-use of information contained in&nbsp;court rulings and decisions</strong>, provided that neither the purpose nor the outcome of such processing is the re-identification of the data subjects; and the processing of biometric data by employers or administrative bodies if it is strictly necessary to control access to workplaces, equipment, and applications used by employees, agents, trainees, or service providers in their assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 6 of the Act N&deg;78-17, <strong>processing of sensitive data can be justified for public interest if it is duly authorised</strong> in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Act. Accordingly, an <strong>authorisation by decree of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a>Conseil d'&Eacute;tat</a>&nbsp;(<em>State Council</em>)&nbsp;is required after reasoned opinion of <a>CNIL</a></strong>, for processing of biometric data on behalf of the State for the authentication of control of the identity of the individuals (Article 32,&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In February 2020, the Administrative Court of Marseille considered the extent to which the <strong>data</strong> <strong>subject&rsquo;s explicit consent may provide an appropriate legal basis</strong> in the deployment of facial recognition systems to control access to high schools in Nice and Marseille (Administrative Court of Marseille, Decision&nbsp;N&deg;1901249 of 27 February 2020). After recognising that data collected <strong>by</strong> <strong>facial recognition constitute biometric data</strong> (para 10), the Court held that the required consent could not be obtained simply by the students or their legal representatives in the case of minors signing a form due to the power imbalance between the targeted public and the public educational establishment as the public authority (para. 12). More importantly, <strong>the Court determined that the biometric data processing could not be justified based on a substantial public interest</strong> (i.e., controlling access to premises) envisioned in Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR in the absence of considerations that the relevant aim could not be achieved by badge checks combined with &ndash; where appropriate &ndash; video surveillance (ibid).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Article 88 of the Act&nbsp;N&deg;78-17 provides the specific limitations of the processing of sensitive data for law enforcement purposes, according to which their processing is prohibited unless it is strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the data subject&rsquo;s rights and freedoms and based on any of the same three grounds listed in Article 10 of the <strong>LED</strong>, including where it is authorised by law.</p>

<p><strong>The Act&nbsp;N&deg;78-17 provides the data subject rights against the processing of their personal data</strong> with restrictions to the exercise of those rights subject to certain conditions (e.g., the restriction for protecting public security to the right to access the data processed for law enforcement purposes pursuant to Art 107 of Act N&deg;78-17). An important data subject&rsquo;s right in the context of biometric surveillance is <strong>the data subject&rsquo;s right not to be subjected to solely automated decision-making, including profiling, except if it is carried out in light of circumstances laid out in Article 22 of the GDPR</strong> and for&nbsp;individual administrative decisions taken in compliance with French legislation (Article 47 of&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17). That said, for the latter circumstance, the automated data processing must not involve sensitive data (Article 47(2),&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17). Regarding the data processing operations relating to State security and defence (Article 120,&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17) and&nbsp;to the&nbsp;prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminal offences (Article 95,&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17),&nbsp;the Act lays out an absolute prohibition against solely automated decision-making, according to which no decision producing legal effects or similarly significant effects can be based on said decision-making intended to predict or assess certain personal aspects of the person concerned. Particularly, with respect to data processing operations for law enforcement purposes, Article 95 of the Act prohibits any type of profiling that discriminates against natural persons based on sensitive data as laid out in Article 6.</p>

<p>In addition to the data protection legislation, <strong>the other legislation applicable to biometric surveillance is the Code of Criminal Procedure.</strong> Its Article R40-26 allows the national police and gendarmerie to retain in a criminal records database (<em><a>Traitement des Ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents Judiciaires</a></em> or <em><a>TAJ</a></em>) photographs of people suspected of having participated in criminal offences as well as victims and&nbsp;persons being investigated for causes of death, serious injury or disappearance&nbsp;to make it possible to use a facial recognition device. According to a 2018 report by Parliament, <strong><a>TAJ</a> contains between 7 and 8 million facial images (<em>Assembl&eacute;e Nationale</em> N&deg;1335, 2018, 64, f.n. 2).</strong> <a>La Quadrature du Net</a> lodged legal complaints against the retention of facial images before the <a>Conseil d'&Eacute;tat</a>, arguing that this practice does not comply with the strict necessity test required under Article 10 of LED and Article 88 of&nbsp;Act N&deg;78-17 (La Quadrature du Net, 2020).</p>

<section>
<h2>Mobilisations and contestations</h2>
<p>The political agenda of Nice&rsquo;s mayor to be at the forefront of biometric mass surveillance technologies in France and possibly in Europe has put him on a collision course with two main actors: <strong>the French Data Protection Authority (<a>CNIL</a>) and human rights/digital rights organisations.</strong></p>
<p>The French digital rights organisation <strong><a>La Quadrature du Net</a> was quick to highlight the problems raised by the deployment of these technologies in Nice</strong>. &ldquo;The safe city is the proliferation of tools from the intelligence community, with a logic of massive surveillance, identification of weak signals and suspicious behaviour," commented F&eacute;lix Tr&eacute;guer, a Marseilles-based leader of the association <a>La Quadrature du Net</a> and member of the campaign Technopolice<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn42" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>42</sup></a>. &ldquo;We do not find it reassuring that the municipal police will become the intelligence service of the urban public space and its digital double" (Allix 2018).</p>
<p><strong>The <a>Ligue des Droits de l&rsquo;Homme</a> emphasised similar points, highlighting the political dangers involved.</strong> As Henri Busquet of the Ligue des Droits de l'Homme in Nice put &ldquo;improving emergency services and traffic is legitimate, but the generalisation of video surveillance worries us, and scrutinising social networks is not the role of a mayor. Without any safeguards, such a tool cannot demonstrate the necessary neutrality [...] It is potentially a tool for political destruction, which puts opponents and journalists at particular risk&rdquo; (Allix 2018).</p>
<p>In July 2019, the city of Nice hoped the <a>CNIL</a> would provide advice related to its first test experiment during the Carnival. The <a>CNIL</a> responded however that not enough information was provided by the municipality for the DPA to assess it. The French DPA pointed out in particular the lack of &ldquo;quantified elements on the effectiveness of the technical device or the concrete consequences of a possible bias (related to gender, skin colour ...) of the software&rdquo; (Dudebout 2020, 3).</p>
<p><strong>The launch of the smartphone application &ldquo;Reporty&rdquo; was the catalyst for mobilisation in Nice, united under the umbrella organisation &ldquo;Collectif anti-Reporty"</strong>. The coalition was formed by local representatives from two left-wing parties (Parti Socialiste, Les Insoumis), Tous Citoyens, the  <a>union CGT</a> and the anti-discrimination NGO MRAP. The coalition appealed to two institutions to block the use of the application: <strong>The Defender of Rights</strong> (D&eacute;fenseur des Droits) and the French DPA (<a>CNIL</a>). The coalition denounced &ldquo;a risk of generalised denunciation and a serious breach of privacy&rdquo;, calling to &ldquo;put an end to the securitarian drift of Christian Estrosi&rdquo; (Barelli 2018).</p>
<p><strong>On 15 March 2018, the <a>CNIL</a> stated that the application was too invasive and did not meet the criteria set out by the legislation</strong>. It did not meet the proportionality test; it failed to fall within the frame of existing law on video-protection due to the integration of private citizens terminals (smartphones) with a security database managed by the police; it was excessively intrusive due to the collection of images and voice of people in the public space and finally it covered a field of offenses that was too broad (CNIL 2018).</p>
<p><strong>The school experimentation further pushed the <a>CNIL</a> to take a position on the technological activism of Nice&rsquo;s mayor.</strong> On 29 October 2019, it expressed serious concerns over the experimentation, arguing that the technology was clashing with the principles of proportionality and data collection minimisation enshrined in the principles of the GDPR. It pointed out that other methods, less intrusive for the privacy of the students, could be used to achieve the technology&rsquo;s stated goal, namely increasing the student&rsquo;s security and traffic fluidity (Dudebout 2020, 4).</p>
<p><strong>In a landmark opinion published on 15 November 2019, the <a>CNIL</a> clarified what it defined as guidelines related to facial recognition (CNIL 2019a).</strong> The French DPA expressed concerns over a blanket and indiscriminate use of the technologies, highlighting possible infringements to fundamental rights, because these technologies operate in the public space, where these freedoms (expression, reunion, protest) are expressed. It however did not suggest that they should be banned in all circumstances &ndash; it suggested instead that its uses could be justified if properly regulated, on a case-by-case basis. <strong>Certain uses could be rejected a priori &ndash; such as in the case of minors, whose data are strictly protected</strong>. The question of data retention is also central, warning against excessive data duration and excessive centralisation, suggesting instead citizen&rsquo;s control over their own data. But as the president of the <a>CNIL</a>, Marie-Laure Denis explained, facial recognition technology &ldquo;can have legitimate uses, and there is a not firm position of the <a>CNIL</a>&rsquo;s board&rdquo; (Untersinger 2019).</p>
<p><strong>The repeated rebukes of the Nice&rsquo;s experimentation with facial recognition technology by the <a>CNIL</a> have however not tempered the enthusiasm of the mayor</strong>. Rather than cave in, Estrosi questioned the legitimacy of the <a>CNIL</a>&rsquo;s decisions, arguing that the legal framework, and in particular the French law of 1978 regulating data collection in relation to digital technologies was itself a limitation. In 2018, Estrosi asked: &ldquo;I have the software that would allow us to apply facial recognition tomorrow morning and to identify registered individuals wherever they are in the city... Why should we prevent this? Do we want to take the risk of seeing people die in the name of individual freedoms, when we have the technology that would allow us to avoid it?&rdquo; (Allix 2018) In December 2019, Estrosi reiterated his attacks on the <a>CNIL</a>, and together with the mayor of Gravelines Bertrand Ringot (Socialist Party) accused the institution of acting as a &ldquo;permanent obstruction to the development of digital experiments&rdquo; (Dudebout 2020, 5).</p>

<h2>Effects of the technologies</h2>
<p>To our knowledge, there has not been any systematic ex-post impact assessment of the effects of these three experiments in the city of Nice.</p>
<p>The city of Nice asked the <a>CNIL</a> to provide an assessment of the Carnival experiment, but the <a>CNIL</a> refused to do so, arguing that not enough information had been communicated to them about the parameters of the experiment.</p>
<p>There are no systematic qualitative or quantitative studies about the perception of the citizens in relation to the technologies in Nice. While the political opposition to these technologies has been documented, it would be erroneous to conclude that they are generally unpopular among the population. Surveys conducted at the national level, such as the one carried out by the organisation Renaissance Num&eacute;rique show that the public is generally supportive. While 51% of the polled citizens consider that the technologies are not transparent, do not sufficiently allow for consent and can potentially lead to mass surveillance, 84% consider it justified for National Security issues (kidnappings, terror attacks), 76% to secure important public events, and 72% consider it justified to secure public spaces in general. Only when asked about their faith in private actors using the technologies properly, the confidence rates decline (38%). (Reconnaissance Num&eacute;rique 2019)).</p>
<p>As one press article reports, &ldquo;For their part, many people in Nice do not seem to be hostile to this application&rdquo;. The article further quotes a 72-year-old from Nice: &ldquo;With terrorism, any measure that allows us to reinforce security seems desirable to me. On the condition that we don't give this application to just anyone". (Barelli 2018)</p>

<li><p>The German federal police, in cooperation with the German railway company, conducted a project called &ldquo;Sicherheitsbahnhof&rdquo; at the Berlin railway station S&uuml;dkreuz in 2017/18, which included 77 video cameras and a video management system.</p></li>
<li><p>The police in Hamburg used facial recognition software <a>Videmo</a> 360 during the protests against the G20 summit in 2017. The database includes 100.000 individuals <a>in Hamburg during the G20 summit</a> and whose profiles are saved in the police database. The technology allows for the determination of behaviour, participation in gatherings, preferences, and religious or political engagement</p></li>
<li><p>Sixty-eight cameras were installed by local police on central squares and places in the German city <a>Mannheim</a> to record the patterns of movement of people. In this project, which started in 2018, the software is used to detect conspicuous behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>Half of these deployments (Mannheim &amp; Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz) took place as measures to test the effectiveness of facial recognition and behavioural analysis software. This &ldquo;justification as a test&rdquo; approach is often used in Germany to argue for a deviation from existing rules and societal expectations and was similarly applied during deviations to commonly agreed measures in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.</p></li>
<li><p>Resistance to video surveillance is also in no small part a result of constant campaigning and protest by German civil society. The Chaos Computer Club and Digital Courage have consistently campaigned against video surveillance and any form of biometric or behavioural surveillance. The long term effect of these &ldquo;pilots&rdquo; is to normalise surveillance.</p></li>

<h2>RBI Deployments in Germany</h2>
<p><strong>All the deployments of RBI we are aware of in Germany were conducted by law enforcement</strong>. The deployments range from using facial recognition software to analyse the German central criminal information system, to specific deployments in more targeted locations such as Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz train station or Mannheim city centre, or to deployments around specific events such as the G20 in Hamburg in 2019.</p>
<section>
<h3><a>Pilot Project S&uuml;dkreuz Berlin</a></h3>
<p><strong><a>The German federal police</a> (BPOL)</strong>, in cooperation with the <a>Deutsche Bahn AG</a>, the German railway company, conducted a project called &ldquo;Sicherheitsbahnhof&rdquo; at the Berlin railway station S&uuml;dkreuz in 2017/18. The project consisted of two parts: part one was done from August 2017 until January 2018 with 312 voluntary participants. Part two was carried out from February until July 2018, including 201 participants (Bundespolizeipr&auml;sidium Potsdam 2018).</p>
<p><strong>For the first project, 77 video cameras and a video management system were installed at the train station Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz.</strong> Three cameras were used for the <strong>biometric facial recognition during live monitoring</strong>. During the project, the systems BioSurveillance by the company <a>Herta Security</a>, delivered by Dell EMC AG, Morpho Video Investigator (MVI) by <a>IDEMIA AG</a>, and <a>AnyVision</a> by Anyvision were used and tested. To detect and identify faces, the systems worked based <strong>on neural networks using Template Matching Methods</strong>. For that purpose, images of the faces were recorded and converted into templates. Subsequently, the facial recognition software matched the unknown picture to a known model saved in the reference database. As soon as a certain threshold of similarity is reached, the image is considered a match (see 2.3. for a technical description) The reference database consisted of high-quality images of the participants. That means the photographs had to adhere to quality standards such as a neutral grey background, no shadow in the faces, enough lighting, low compression to avoid artefacts, high resolution, and a straightforward viewing direction (Bundespolizeipr&auml;sidium Potsdam 2018).</p>
<p><strong>For the first testing phase,</strong> the participants passed the designated area of the train station Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz a total of 41.000 times. BioSurveillance had an average hit rate of 68,5%, MVI of 31,7%, and <a>AnyVision</a> 63,1%. <strong>A combined hit rate by the interconnection of the three systems resulted in an increased total hit rate of 84,9%.</strong> <strong>The interconnection also increased the rate of false positives.</strong> The matches were logged but not saved (Bundespolizeipr&auml;sidium Potsdam 2018).</p>
<p><strong>For the second testing phase</strong>, the reference database consisted of participant images from the video stream of the first testing phase. For each participant, 2-5 images were extracted from the video stream. The images recorded during the second testing phase generally were of worse quality than from the first phase. All systems used more than one picture as a reference to identify a person (Bundespolizeipr&auml;sidium Potsdam 2018). During the second phase, the interconnected systems had <strong>an average testing rate of 91,2%.</strong> BioSurveillance resulted in an average hit rate of 82,8%, MVI in 31,2%, and <a>AnyVision</a> in 76,2%. The performance increased as the systems had more images as a reference (Bundespolizeipr&auml;sidium Potsdam 2018).</p>
<p><strong>The <a>Deutsche Bahn AG</a> used the existing infrastructure at the railway station Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz for an experiment on behavioural analysis starting in June 2019.</strong> The tests were done twice a week during the day. Volunteers performed situations the system should recognise and identify. After scanning people's behaviour, the software would alert the police or the railway company (Henning 2019). <strong>The police assembled a list of behaviours that should be recognised by the system: people lying down or entering certain zones of the train station (such as construction areas), groups of people or streams of people, objects that were set down such as luggage, and the positions of persons and objects</strong>. Furthermore, the system would be counting the number of people in certain areas and allow the analysis of the video data by the police. The software used by the tests is provided by <a>IBM Germany GmbH</a>, the <a>Hitachi Consortium</a> (<a>Hitachi</a>, <a>Conef</a>, <a>MIG</a>), <a>Funkwerk video systems GmbH</a> and <a>G2K Group GmbH</a> (Bundespolizei 2019).</p>

<h3>Hamburg G20 Summit </h3>
<p><strong>The police in Hamburg used facial recognition software <a>Videmo</a> 360 (by <a>Videmo</a>)</strong> during the protests against the <a>G20 summit in 2017</a> (Br&ouml;ckling 2019). The database, consisting of 100 TB of data, consists of material the police assembled during recording identities in investigations and data from external sources such as surveillance cameras in train stations, the BKA's online portal called &ldquo;Boston Infrastruktur&rdquo;, from the internet and the media. <strong>"Boston Infrastruktur" is a web portal accessible to the public in July 2017, where people could upload images and videos</strong>. <strong>All data that concerns the time and place of the G20 summit were included.</strong> Furthermore, data were assembled in 2017 during investigations of the special commission &ldquo;Schwarzer Block&rdquo; in the context of the G20 summit protests. The images were first detected and identified, meaning templates of faces were made. <strong>Subsequently, experts checked the material manually (Caspar 2018). The database includes 100.000 individuals in Hamburg during the G20 summit and whose profiles are saved in the police database.</strong> The technology allows for the determination of behaviour, participation in gatherings, preferences, and religious or political engagement (Br&ouml;ckling 2019).</p>

<h3><a>Mannheim public surveillance</a></h3>
<p><strong>68 cameras were installed by local police on central squares and places in the German city Mannheim to record the moving patterns of people.</strong> In this project, which started in 2018, the software developed by the <strong><a>Fraunhofer Institute of Optronics</a> in Karlsruhe</strong> is used to detect conspicuous behaviour. The police are alerted by the cameras and investigate the emerging situation they have observed on camera further (Reuter 2018). The cameras were placed in areas with increased incidences of criminal activity. Only two minutes lie between the alert of the system and the intervention by the police on average. <strong>As the software is learning, it is increasingly able to detect criminal or violent activity. However, sometimes the alerts are not correct, for instance, the system cannot recognise a hug as not dangerous (heise online 2020).</strong> The software is continuously tested and adapted to be suitable for public spaces. Twenty cameras are used to test the software (Ministerium f&uuml;r Inneres 2020).</p>

<h2>Legal bases and challenges</h2>
<p><strong>The question on the legal permissibility of examples of biometric video surveillance explained above requires a brief description of the constitutional and legislative framework</strong> for the protection of privacy and personal data, and the police powers granted under the German law in relation to the use and processing of personal data.</p>
<p>The general right of personality based on <strong>Articles 2(1) and 1(1) of the German Constitution</strong> <strong>protects individuals against the collection, storage, and use of their personal data by public authorities (Eichenhofer and Gusy, 2017).</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic right to informational self-determination guarantees the authority to decide on the disclosure and also on the type of use of one's personal data (BVerfG, judgment of 15 December 1983 - 1 BvR 209/83, para. 149).</p>

<p><strong>Germany adapted a new&nbsp;Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), to use the discretionary powers and the application of national laws contained in the GDPR</strong>. The <strong>BDSG</strong> also contains data protection provisions on the processing of personal data by activities of public federal bodies which do not fall within the scope of Union law (e.g., intelligence services, Federal Armed Forces) (Part 4, BDSG) and implements the <strong>LED</strong> (Part 3, BDSG).</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 22 of the BDSG sets out lawful purposes additional to those listed in Article 9 of the GDPR</strong> for which sensitive data may be processed. For the purpose of this report, the lawful purposes that are relevant for public bodies processing operations are the following: (i) processing is <strong>urgently necessary for reasons of substantial public interest</strong>; (ii) processing is necessary to <strong>prevent substantial threats to public security</strong>; (iii) processing is urgently necessary to <strong>prevent substantial harm to the common good or to safeguard substantial concerns of the common good</strong>; (iv) processing is necessary for <strong>urgent reasons of defence or to fulfil supra- or intergovernmental obligations of a public body</strong>. In each case, the interests sought with any of these purposes must outweigh the data subject&rsquo;s interest. <strong>Paragraph 22 of the BDSG</strong> further imposes obligations such as access restriction and encryption in relation to implementing appropriate safeguards to protect the data subjects&rsquo; interest when the processing is carried out based on the above purposes. Furthermore <strong>&sect;27 of the BDSG</strong> envisages the <strong>processing of sensitive data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to certain conditions</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In regard to the processing of sensitive data for law enforcement purposes, <strong>&sect;48 of the BDSG</strong> permits the processing only where it is <strong>strictly necessary for the performance of the competent authority&rsquo;s task</strong>, and subject to the <strong>existence of certain safeguards such as those in relation to data security and encryption</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of the further use of the data, <strong>&sect;23 of the BDSG</strong> designates purposes for which personal data <strong>may be processed other than the initial intended purpose</strong> such as where it is necessary to prevent substantial harm to common good, threat to public security, defence, or national security or where it is necessary to prevent serious harms to others&rsquo; rights. <strong>&sect;49 of the BDSG</strong> lays out the rules for the <strong>processing of personal data for law-enforcement purposes</strong> other than the initial intended law enforcement purpose.</p>

<p>Moreover, the <strong>BDSG devotes a specific section to the processing of personal data while conducting video surveillance</strong>. Pursuant to <strong>&sect;4 of the BDSG</strong>, video surveillance of public spaces is <strong>permitted&nbsp;only as far as it is necessary</strong> (i)&nbsp;for public bodies to perform their tasks; (ii)&nbsp;to exercise the right to determine who shall be allowed or denied access, or&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;to safeguard legitimate interests for specifically defined purposes. There should be nothing to indicate that the data subject&rsquo;s legitimate interest overrides the interest protected by any of the respective purposes and protecting lives, health and freedom of people should be considered as a very important interest (&sect;4, the BDSG). More importantly, the <strong>data collected through the use of video surveillance can be further processed if it is necessary to prevent threats to state and public security and to prosecute crimes&nbsp;(&sect;4(4), the BDSG).</strong> The same section further provides conditions for notification at the earliest possible moment about the surveillance, informing the data subject whose personal data may be collected as a result of the surveillance and the deletion of the data if it is no longer necessary.</p>

<p><strong>The BDSG restricts the application of certain data subject rights</strong> as enshrined in the GDPR such as the right to be informed (&sect;33) and the right to request access (&sect;34). &sect;37 of the Act provides a sectorial exception in relation to providing services pursuant to an insurance contract for the prohibition against the sole automated decision-making. In relation to the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes, <strong>the BDSG permits the sole automated decision-making if it is authorised by law (&sect;55)</strong>. Nevertheless, the decision cannot be based on sensitive data unless there are suitable safeguards to the data subject (&sect;55(2)). In any case, it <strong>provides an explicit prohibition against conducting profiling that may discriminate against people based on their sensitive data (&sect;55(3)).</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The collection of personal data in general and facial images in particular in criminal investigation proceedings are authorised under German Law by the Federal Police Act (<em>Gesetz u&#776;ber die Bundespolizei</em>) (BPoIG),</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;the Federal Criminal Police Office and the Cooperation of the Federal and State Governments in Criminal Police Matters (<em><a>Bundeskriminalamtgesetz</a></em>) (BKAG), the Code of Criminal Procedure (<em>Strafprozessordnung</em>) (StPO), and the police acts of&nbsp;<em>L&auml;nder</em>.</p>

<p><strong>&sect;24 of the&nbsp;BPoIG&nbsp;grants the Federal Police the authority to take photographs including image recordings of a person subject to specific conditions</strong>. Moreover, <strong>&sect;26 of the&nbsp;BPoIG</strong>, entrusts the Federal Police the power to collect personal data by making <strong>picture and sound recordings of participants in public events or gatherings</strong> if facts justify that there are significant risks to border security or to categories of people or objects. &sect;27 of the&nbsp;BPoIG&nbsp;further authorises the use of <strong>automatic image recording</strong>, albeit in relation to security risks at the border or to categories of people or objects. Each section provides the obligations for the deletion of the data after a specific timeframe.</p>

<p><strong>The BKAG provides the rules for information collection by the&nbsp;Federal Criminal Police Office in its information system</strong>, BKAG established pursuant to&nbsp;&sect;13 of the BKAG.&nbsp;&sect;12 of the Act allows the processing of personal data by the Office for&nbsp;purposes other than those for which they were collected in order to <strong>prevent, investigate, and prosecute serious crimes</strong>. Additionally, the personal data of people who are convicted of, accused of, and suspected of committing a crime, and for whom there are factual indications that they may commit crimes of considerable importance in the near future may be processed to identify that person. (&sect;12, para. 5, the BKAG).&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Article states that&nbsp;personal data obtained by taking photos or image recordings of a person by means of covert use of technical means in or out of homes may not be further processed for law enforcement purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&sect;81b of the StPO grants the police the authority to obtain the photographs and fingerprints of a suspect and any of his measurements in order to conduct criminal proceedings</strong>. &sect;100h of the StPO covers the police power to conduct <strong>covert surveillance measures,</strong> which includes the recording of the photographs and other images of the person concerned outside of private premises where other means of establishing the facts or determining an accused&rsquo;s whereabouts would offer less prospect of success or would be more difficult. <strong>In terms of the investigative powers of police</strong> to use personal data in general, &sect;98c of the StPO <strong>grants the authority to automatic matching of personal data from criminal proceedings with other data stored for the purposes of criminal prosecution or the enforcement of a sentence, or in order to avert a danger.</strong>&nbsp;This is, however, subject to the specific rules under federal law or&nbsp;<em>L&auml;nder</em>&nbsp;law. &sect;483 of the StPO authorises a number of authorities to process personal data where necessary for the purposes of criminal proceedings including for criminal proceedings other than the one for which the data were collected. &sect;484 of the StPO allows for the processing of personal data for future criminal proceedings.</p>

<h2>Mobilisations and contestations</h2>
<p>What is notable about these deployments, is that two thirds of them (Mannheim &amp; Berlin S&uuml;dkreuz) <strong>took place as measures to test the effectiveness of facial recognition and behavioural analysis software</strong>. This &ldquo;justification as a test&rdquo; approach is often used in Germany to argue for a <strong>deviation from existing rules and societal expectations and was similarly applied during deviations to commonly agreed measures in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. Similar special justifications were used for <strong>biometric surveillance around the G20 in Hamburg</strong>, which was justified by referencing the <strong>exceptional security threats associated with these large summits</strong>. Thus, three out of four implementations of biometric or behavioural surveillance in Germany - and all of those in Germany using video data - <strong>require special justifications in order to be able to take place at all</strong>. Notably, German civil society such as the Chaos Computer Club - a central civil society watchdog promoting fundamental rights in the digital age - have criticised these &ldquo;tests&rdquo; as not being very scientific in nature (Chaos Computer Club 2018).</p>
<p><strong>The Berlin experiments were criticised as being unscientific in the handling of the data</strong>, the low number of participants and the use of pictures of high quality in the database. Moreover, the Chaos Computer Club asserted that the <strong>results would not justify using the technology on a bigger scale as it did not function very well due to its low hit rate</strong> (Chaos Computer Club 2018). The fact that such special justifications are even needed in order to conduct biometric or behavioural surveillance in Germany, suggests that it is highly unpopular in society. Both the <strong>German public and civil society have argued strongly against all forms of video surveillance,</strong> which is itself already uncommon compared to many other places in Europe. In this context, <strong>biometric or behavioural surveillance has been very difficult to justify.</strong> Even when behavioural surveillance projects receive approval from data protection authorities (Wazulin 2019a), these projects are still criticised for not taking privacy sufficiently seriously (Wazulin 2019b).</p>
<p><strong>However outside of Mannheim, German DPAs have been one of the central actors contesting biometric and behavioural video surveillance</strong>. Once given the opportunity to analyse the usage of biometric video surveillance during the G20, <strong>the Hamburg data protection</strong> <strong>authority</strong> (<em>Hamburgische Beauftragte f&uuml;r Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit</em>)&nbsp;<strong>found this use to be in breach of data protection laws</strong> (Schemm 2018). It considered that the StPO <strong>did not provide the legal basis to authorise that surveillance on the basis that the facial recognition technology took place independently of the initiation of a specific investigation</strong> (DPA Hamburg, 12). The Hamburg DPA further argued that &sect;98c of the StPO did not <strong>provide the legal basis for authorisation because it covers only the comparing of the data and assumes the legality of the other data processing cycle (e.g., collection and storage)</strong>. A criminal suspicion is not a pre-requisite to conduct the comparison, and, on that basis, the Hamburg DPA argued that it authorised only minor interferences with fundamental rights (25). Along those arguments on the legality of the biometric video surveillance at the G20 summit, <strong>the Hamburg DPA ordered the database of data collected by the police during that surveillance to be deleted</strong> (Caspar 2018) but were unsuccessful in a legal battle with the Hamburg police to compel them to delete the database (Br&ouml;ckling 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Resistance against video surveillance is also in no small part a result of constant campaigning and protest by German civil society.</strong> The <strong>Chaos Computer Club and Digital Courage</strong> have consistently campaigned against video surveillance and any form of biometric or behavioural surveillance. <strong>The widely popular online blog Netzpolitik.org</strong> has also reported extensively on video surveillance technologies, as have other leading German media outlets like Sueddeutsche Zeitung or Die Zeit. As a result, it is <strong>difficult to implement biometric or behavioural surveillance in Germany without being noticed by civil society and engaging in a public debate about whether these forms of surveillance are appropria</strong>te. Therefore, biometric, or behavioural surveillance can only be found in a limited set of cases in Germany, for which purported tests or exceptional justifications are typically required.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Effects of the technologies: normalising surveillance</h2>
<p><strong>As there have only been a few implementations of behavioural or biometric surveillance in Germany, many of which have been as part of tests or for &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;, their effects are relatively hard to measure.</strong> In some cases this can lead to a normalisation of video surveillance, as was the case in Hamburg (Gr&ouml;hn 2017). The video surveillance cameras that were installed for the G20 summit remain in use and additional video surveillance cameras have since been installed.</p>
<p><strong>All of the video data stored by the Hamburg police during the G20 remains stored by the police and even if the Hamburg data protection authority believes that it should be removed, deletion is not currently possible.</strong> This video data includes several days of footage from central Hamburg from 6-10 July 2017 and includes many people going about their daily lives without any indication of committing a crime (Monroy 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Another element of normalisation is in regard to the integration of biometric facial recognition for historical data using the <a>German central criminal information system INPOL</a>.</strong> Historical data of the usage of the systems shows a systematic year on year increase in the number of requests being made to the system by the German police (Monroy 2020), even though the number of criminal offenses has gone down steadily over the past decade (Statista 2021).</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Hungarian Government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n has long been on a collision course with EU Institutions over the rule of law and the undermining of the country&rsquo;s judicial independence and democratic institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Hungary is a frontrunner in Europe when it comes to authorising law enforcement&rsquo;s use of Facial Recognition Technology, developing a nationwide and centralised database (The <a>Dragonfly Project</a>), and using the <a>Home Quarantine App</a> as part of the Government&rsquo;s Coronavirus measures.</p></li>
<li><p>The infrastructure in place that potentially allows for a centralised deployment of biometric mass surveillance technologies in Hungary has reached an unprecedented scale while the legal and ethical scrutiny of these technologies lags dangerously behind.</p></li>
<li><p>This is due to (1) the overlap between the private and public sectors, specifically government institutions, and (2) the complex entanglements biometric systems have with other information systems (such as car registries, traffic management, public transport monitoring and surveillance, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Although the latter are not concerned with the traces of the human body they can nonetheless be used for and facilitate biometric mass surveillance.

<li><p>The <a>Dragonfly Project</a> has elicited numerous warnings regarding data protection and the rights to privacy from both public and private organisations. However the lack of contestation and social debate around the issues of privacy and human rights in relation to such projects as the Hungarian Government&rsquo;s Dragonfly is striking.</p></li>
</ul>
</div> 
<p>Under the Government of Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n, Hungary has been on a collision course with EU Institutions. It has centralised and consolidated its power by marginalising civil society and curtailing the autonomy of Hungarian media, cultural and higher education institutions (Csaky 2020; Gehrke 2020; Verseck 2020). Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s continued <strong>erosion of the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions</strong> was further advanced with the 2020 adoption of an emergency law which allows the government to rule by decree (Schlagwein 2020; Stolton 2020). In this context, the latest developments in using Biometric Identification Technologies in Hungary flag serious concerns regarding the rule of law, human rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p>Hungary is a frontrunner in Europe when it comes to authorising law enforcement&rsquo;s use of Facial Recognition Technology, developing a nationwide and centralised database, and using the <a>Home Quarantine App</a> as part of the Government&rsquo;s Coronavirus measures. The infrastructure in place that potentially allows for a <strong>centralised deployment of biometric mass surveillance technologies</strong> in Hungary has reached an unprecedented scale while the legal and ethical scrutiny of these technologies lags dangerously behind. This is due to (1) <strong>the overlap between the private and public sectors</strong>, specifically government institutions, and (2) due to the <strong>complex entanglements biometric systems have with other information systems (such as car registries, traffic management, public transport monitoring and surveillance, etc.).</strong> Although the latter are not concerned with the traces of the human body they can nonetheless be used for and facilitate biometric mass surveillance. These entanglements create <strong>grey zones</strong> of biometric mass surveillance where the development and deployment of such technologies is hidden from visibility and critical scrutiny.</p>
<h2>Remote Biometric Identification in Hungary</h2>

<h3>The <a>Hungarian Police</a>&rsquo;s use of Facial Recognition</h3>

<p>On 10 December 2019 the Hungarian Parliament passed a package of amendments of acts for the work of law enforcement in Hungary. Entitled &ldquo;the simplification and digitisation of some procedures&rdquo; this adjustment legalised <strong>the use of forensic &ndash; but also live &ndash; FRT by the <a>Hungarian Police</a></strong> (Hungarian Parliament 2019). In cases when a person identified by the police cannot present an ID document, the police agents can take a photograph of the individual on location, take fingerprints, and record the biometric data based on &ldquo;perception and measurement&rdquo; of external characteristics. The photo taken on location can be instantly verified against the database of the national registry of citizens. The <strong>automatic search</strong> is performed by a face recognition algorithm and the five closest matches are returned to the police agent who, based on these photos proceeds with identifying the person (1994. &Eacute;vi XXXIV. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny, para 29/4(a)). This application of FRT does not fall under the category of mass surveillance; however, it is only possible due to <strong>a central system which collects and centralises the national and other biometric databases</strong> but also provides the technical support for accessing it in a quick and affective way by various operational units. In this instance by the patrolling police. &nbsp;</p>
<section>
<h3>The Dragonfly (Szitak&ouml;t&#337;) Project</h3>
<p>In 2018 the <a>Ministry of Interior</a> presented a bill in the Hungarian Government that proposed a <strong>centralised CCTV system with data stored in one centralised database called the Governmental Data Centre</strong> (Korm&aacute;nyzati Adatk&ouml;zpont, abbreviated as KAK). All&nbsp;governmental&nbsp;operations aiming at&nbsp;developing&nbsp;this centralised database run under the name <strong>Szitak&ouml;t&#337; (Dragonfly)</strong>.&nbsp;This central storage facility collects surveillance data of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, parking facilities, etc.); the Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK); bank security and the Hungarian Public Road PLC. The project with an estimated budget of 50 billion forints (160 million euros) proposes to centralise about <strong>35.000 CCTV cameras and 25.000 terabytes of monitoring data</strong> from across the country (NAIH 2018). While the project, and notably the response of Dr. Attila P&eacute;terfalvi, head of the Hungarian Data Protection Authority, - Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information&nbsp;(NAIH), who warned of the lack of data protection considerations in the bill, have been largely mediatised, this has done little for halting the Project which has already been rolled out. In 2015 the Hungarian company GVSX Ltd (Hungary). Had already been contracted (NISZ-GVSX 2019) to implement an Integrated Traffic Management and Control System called IKSZR (Integr&aacute;lt K&ouml;zleked&eacute;sszervez&eacute;si &eacute;s Szab&aacute;lyoz&aacute;si Rendszer) that centralises data from various systems such as ANPR cameras, car parks, traffic monitoring, meteorological data, etc. The <a>Dragonfly Project</a> has been designed as an expansion of this system by <strong>centralising the data flowing from both the IKSZR system, the databases of the National Infocommunication Services (NISZ) and also CCTV data from other public and private surveillance systems</strong> such as those operated by local governments, public transport companies and banks.</p>

<p>The technical description of the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> does not make any explicit reference to (live) facial recognition technology, however, the system <strong>collects, stores and searches, in real time, video surveillance footage from 35.000 CCTV cameras</strong>. However, from the reports of the <a>Hungarian Civil Liberties Union</a> (HCLU or TASZ in Hungarian) and the DPA, it is known (NAIH 2019, 139) that <strong>to some extend FRT has been used by the Secret Service for National Security (SSNS)</strong>, one of the national security services of Hungary. According to the DPA&rsquo;s investigation all the cases in which FRT has been used happened <strong>in relation to concrete (criminal) cases looking for a missing person or someone under warrant</strong>. These cases were also <strong>limited to specific geographic locations</strong> (NAIH 2019). According to the DPA&rsquo;s investigation, in 2019 the <span> </span> FRT system operated by the SSNS found 6.000 matches, which resulted in around 250 instances of stop-and-search and 4 arrests (NAIH 2019). The numbers for 2020 are inconsistent with those given for 2019 (3 matches, 28 instances of stop-and-search, unknown number of arrests), however, this is probably due to the fact that <strong>the system has since been moved primarily to the jurisdiction of the <a>Hungarian Police</a></strong>.</p>

<p>While the legal framework for police checks does refer to the use of facial recognition technologies, the national security act does not mention it. This is even more striking as the SSNS, is <strong>known to be using FRT to provide the national security services, the police, or other authorised institutions (e.g., prosecutor&rsquo;s office, tax office, etc.) classified information</strong>.</p>

<p>Two interrelated companies are responsible for the development, maintenance, and administration of this single central system:&nbsp;<strong>the NISZ and <a>IdomSoft</a> Ltd., both owned by the state.</strong>&nbsp;The NISZ or National Infocommunication Services is a 100% state owned company that only in 2020 signed 6 contracts to purchase the necessary&nbsp;<strong>hardware, storage, and other IT equipment for implementing the <a>Dragonfly Project</a></strong>. While Public Procurement documents (K&ouml;zbeszerz&eacute;si Hat&oacute;s&aacute;g, 2020) bear witness to the ongoing investments and development of the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> by the Hungarian Government, a comprehensive overview of the project, the stages of its implementation or its budget, is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>The other company responsible for the administration of the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> is the <a>IdomSoft</a> company, a member of the so called NISZ group. Idomsoft is a 100% indirect state-owned company (indirect ownership means that the government owns shares, but not through authorised state institutions or through other organisations) that, according to its website, &ldquo;plays a leading role in the <strong>development, integration, installation and operation of IT systems of national importance</strong>&rdquo;. Apart from administering the National Dragonfly Database, Idomsoft also assures the <strong>interoperability of the various national databases</strong> such as the citizen&rsquo;s registry, passport and visa databases, car registries, and police alerts, and it connects the Hungarian databases into the <strong>Schengen Information System</strong> (SIS II).</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> the Hungarian government has been collecting video surveillance data that is centralised in the <strong>Governmental Data Centre</strong> (Korm&aacute;nyzati Adatk&ouml;zpont) in the same location and by the same institutions that administer the national registry of citizens, visa-entries, police databases, and also other e-governmental databases such as related to social security, tax office or health records.</p>

<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a temporary halt of movement in public spaces, it also facilitated the <strong>introduction of new tracking technologies.</strong> Hungary is among two countries in Europe (Poland being the other) to introduce a <strong><a>Home Quarantine App</a></strong> which uses automated face recognition technology to verify that people stay in quarantine for the required time.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;The normalisation of biometric surveillance at home: The Hungarian <a>Home Quarantine App</a></h3>
<p>In May 2020 Hungarian Authorities rolled out two digital applications, the contract-tracing app called <strong>VirusRadar</strong> (Kasz&aacute;s 2020) and the <strong><a>Home Quarantine App</a></strong> (H&aacute;zi Karant&eacute;n Rendszer, abreviated HKR). Both of these apps are centralised tracing apps meaning that they send contact logs with pseudonymised personal data to a central (government) back-end server (Council of Europe 2020, 28). While the VirusRadar only uses Bluetooth data and proximity of other devices, the <strong>HKR processes biometric data</strong> when comparing facial images of its users.</p>
<p>Those who, according to the COVID-19 regulations in Hungary, are confined to home quarantine are offered the option to use the app instead of being checked by the police. For those who return from abroad, the use of the app is compulsory. But even those who can choose are encourage by the authorities to make use of the HKR app otherwise they will be subjected to frequent visits by police agents. <strong>Once a person downloads the app, its use becomes compulsory</strong> and failure to do so or attempts to evade its tracking is considered an administrative offense. From a data protection law point of view, this is a clear case where the data subject&rsquo;s consent (and in the case of biometric data, their explicit consent) cannot provide the lawful ground for the processing of data through the app (see section 4.2.2). Even if the processing can be based on another lawful ground such as public interest, the punitive nature of non-compliance may raise issues in terms of adhering to the necessity test, which requires a balancing act between the objective pursued and the data subject&rsquo;s interests.</p>

<p>The HKR app is <strong>developed by <a>Asura Technologies</a> and implemented by <a>IdomSoft</a> Ltd</strong>., the same company that provides the software and technical implementation for the nation-wide <a>Dragonfly Project</a>. The HKR application works with <strong>face recognition technology combined with location verification</strong>. The application sends notifications at random times prompting the user to <strong>upload a facial image</strong> while retrieving the location data of the mobile device. &nbsp;The user must respond within 15 minutes and the location data must match the address registered for quarantine. In order for the <a>Home Quarantine App</a> to work, the user first needs to upload a facial image which is compared by a police officer with the photo of the same individual stored in the central database. After this <strong>facial verification</strong>, the app creates <strong>a biometric template on the mobile phone of the user</strong> and the photo is deleted. The consecutive photos are only compared to this biometric template, so neither the photos nor the template leave the personal device.&nbsp;If there is suspicion about the identity or whereabouts of the user, a police officer visits the address to make sure that the person is adhering to the quarantine rules.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the HKR app, &mdash; just like the contact tracing app VirusRadar, which was developed <span> </span> by Nextsense &mdash; has been <strong>&ldquo;donated&rdquo; to the Hungarian Government by <a>Asura Technologies</a> &ldquo;free of charge&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Legal bases and challenges</h2>
<p>The creation of a <strong>nation-wide and centralised database</strong> that uses facial recognition technology may raise important legal questions on its compliance under the constitutional framework and the data protection legislation. <strong>Article 6 of the Fundamental Law of Hungary</strong> affirms the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data. They are implemented by&nbsp;the <strong>Right to Informational Self-Determination and Freedom of Information</strong>&nbsp;(<em>2011. &eacute;vi CXII. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny az inform&aacute;ci&oacute;s &ouml;nrendelkez&eacute;si jogr&oacute;l &eacute;s az inform&aacute;ci&oacute;szabads&aacute;gr&oacute;l</em>) (<em>Infotv</em>), which was amended in 2018 to use the discretionary powers and application of national laws contained in the GDPR. With the amendments, the Act also provides rules for the data processing activities that fall outside the scope of the GDPR and implements the LED.&nbsp;The sectoral laws on the processing of personal data have been amended as of 2019 to comply with the GDPR.</p>

<p>The Infovt <strong>permits the processing of sensitive data where:</strong> (i) the processing is <strong>necessary and proportionate</strong> to protect the vital interest of the data subject or another person; (ii) the data is made <strong>publicly available</strong> by the data subject; (iii) the processing is absolutely necessary and proportionate for the implementation of an <strong>international treaty, or is required by law for the enforcement of fundamental rights, national security, prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal offences</strong> (&sect;5). Furthermore, in relation to processing of (non-sensitive) &ldquo;personal criminal data&rdquo; (<em>b&#369;n&uuml;gyi szem&eacute;lyes adat</em>), which is personal data obtained during criminal justice proceedings, can only be processed by state or municipal bodies for the prevention, detection and prosecution of criminal offenses and for administrative and judicial tasks, as well as criminal, civil and non-judicial matters (&sect;5(4)).</p>

<p>In regard to the data subjects&rsquo; rights, notably, the Infovt permits <strong>sole automated decision-making</strong>, whereby a decision based on the sole automated decision-making process may be taken if it is permitted by national law or EU law and subject to certain conditions (&sect;6). The sole automated decision <strong>can be based on sensitive data&nbsp;if it is authorised by national law or EU law</strong> (&sect;6(c)).</p>
<p>Recently, the Hungarian Government issued a Decree <strong>(Decree No. 179/2020 of 4 May)</strong> as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic for which it declared <strong>a &ldquo;state of emergency&rdquo; (Stolton 2020)</strong>. The Decree <strong>restricts the scope of a number of the data subject&rsquo;s rights</strong> such as the right to be informed. The EDPB (2021b) was highly critical of those restrictions. It particularly considered that although the state of emergency adopted in the context of a pandemic may serve as a circumstance to trigger Article 23 of the GDPR, according to which EU Member States can restrict the scope of the data subject rights and certain data protection principles (see section 4.2.2), those states must nevertheless adhere to the guarantees enshrined in the same Article for those restrictions to be legal under the GDPR (ibid). It went further to emphasise the fundamental rights requirements that must be observed and <strong>a general blanket restriction on the scope of the data subject&rsquo;s rights would infringe upon the essence of fundamental rights</strong> (ibid).</p>
<p>In terms of the <strong>public authorities&rsquo; power to use sensitive data in relation to criminal proceedings</strong>, &sect; 269 of the Criminal Procedure Act (<em>2017. &eacute;vi XC. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny a bu&#776;ntet&#337;elj&aacute;r&aacute;sr&oacute;</em>) authorises the prosecutor's office, the investigating authority, and the crime prevention, detection and counter-terrorism bodies of the police <strong>to request the existing biometric data</strong> held in accordance with the Act on the criminal registry system, the registry of judgments against Hungarian citizens passed by the courts of Member States of the European Union and the registry of criminal and police biometric data (<em>2009. &eacute;vi XLVII. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny a b&#369;n&uuml;gyi nyilv&aacute;ntart&aacute;si rendszerr&#337;l, az Eur&oacute;pai Uni&oacute; tag&aacute;llamainak b&iacute;r&oacute;s&aacute;gai &aacute;ltal Magyar &aacute;llampolg&aacute;rokkal szemben hozott &iacute;t&eacute;letek nyilv&aacute;ntart&aacute;s&aacute;r&oacute;l, valamint a b&#369;n&uuml;gyi &eacute;s rend&eacute;szeti biometrikus adatok nyilv&aacute;ntart&aacute;s&aacute;r&oacute;l</em>)&nbsp;and <strong>request facial image analysis from the body responsible for the management and operation of the facial image register.</strong></p>
<p>The Act on Facial Image Analysis Registry and the Facial Image Analysis System (<em>2015. &eacute;vi CLXXXVIII. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny az arck&eacute;pelemz&eacute;si nyilv&aacute;ntart&aacute;sr&oacute;l &eacute;s az arck&eacute;pelemz&#337; rendszerr&#337;l</em>) creates <strong>a registry for the processing of biometric data</strong> in relation to identifications at border crossings and for law enforcement purposes (&sect;3 and &sect;4) and it provides <strong>a list of a number of authorities that can request facial image analysis</strong> ((&sect;9). It is reported that the <strong>Special Service for National Security</strong>, which carries out secret surveillance operations under the National Security Services Act (<em>1995. &eacute;vi CXXV. T&ouml;rv&eacute;ny a nemzetbiztons&aacute;gi szolg&aacute;latokr&oacute;l</em>), has <strong>broad powers to request data from the registry</strong> (Hidve&#769;gi and Za&#769;goni, 2016).</p>
<p>As is mentioned repeatedly in this section, the Dragonfly project was introduced with legal amendments to a range of laws (see section 10.1) and was subject to criticisms by the NAIH (see section 10.3). It thus remains to be seen whether the legal basis of the project would also satisfy the ECHR and Charter requirements.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Mobilisations and contestations</h2>
<p>The <a>Dragonfly Project</a> has elicited <strong>numerous warnings</strong> regarding data protection and the rights to privacy from both public and private organisations (TASZ 2021). The <strong>Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information&nbsp;(NAIH)</strong>, in October 2018 filed a communique (NAIH 2018) in which it stresses the problems raised by the centralisation and storing of visual data from as many as 35.000 CCTV cameras from all over the country and public transport facilities resulting in 25.000 terabytes of surveillance data.</p>

<p>The main concerns, according to the NAIH, stemmed from the fact that <strong>once the surveillance data is centralised the collecting bodies stop being the official administrators of these databases</strong>. Moreover, they won&rsquo;t even know how and by whom the data is collected, accessed and utilised, or for what purposes. What is even more worrisome according to this communique, is that the <strong>centralised database (Governmental Data Centre) would not administer the data either, they would only process it</strong>. Therefore, while the database can be accessed and more or less freely &ldquo;used&rdquo; by a number of clients (such as government organisations, law enforcement, secret services) there is <strong>no legal body who is responsible for applying the data protection measures or who would be liable in case of transgressions.</strong> Eventually the government incorporated some of the suggestions and owners of the data remain the uploading bodies to whom the requests have to be addressed for accessing the database by the different authorised bodies (e.g., the <a>Hungarian Police</a>).</p>

<p>Independent Hungarian media has also picked up the news. For instance, Hungary&rsquo;s <strong>leading independent economic and political weekly HVG</strong> has published an article in which they outline the bill and cite the head of the NAIH (Dercs&eacute;nyi 2018). Interestingly, the article starts with an announcement/amendment saying that the HVG expresses its regrets for violating the good reputation of the Ministry of Internals when claiming that the bill has not incorporated the suggestions from the NAIH, which is not true (Dercs&eacute;nyi 2018). However, the article still claims the opposite. <strong>Other liberal online news sites and Magazines</strong> such as the Magyar Narancs (Szalai 2019), 444.hu (Herczeg 2019) and 24.hu (Ker&eacute;kgy&aacute;rt&oacute; 2018; Spirk 2019) also report on the case. However, t<strong>he main pro-government newspapers such as Magyar Nemzet remain silent.</strong></p>

<p>More recently, in January 2021, the <strong>INCLO, a network of Human Liberties NGOs</strong> published a report (INCLO 2021) in which they discuss the Hungarian Case and specifically the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> as an example of how the employment of FRT is at odds with the right to privacy and civil liberties. They mainly flag their concern that <strong>due to the inadequate regulation FRT can be used in conjunction with the CCTV network developed at an alarming rate.</strong></p>

<p>In an interview, one of the authors of the INCLO case study, legal expert &Aacute;d&aacute;m Remport, explains:</p>
<section>
<blockquote>Regarding secret surveillance in general the problem is the <strong>lack of adequate supervision and an effective remedial system</strong>. The legal provisions governing national security agencies are mostly satisfactory. However, they are not necessarily enforced, or <strong>if they are breached, there&rsquo;s no way to find ou</strong>t. Not via the court &mdash;which is what our latest cases show&mdash; not via Parliament&rsquo;s national security committee, due to the quorum: in order for the national security committee to be operational, the majority of its members must be present. Given that the ruling Fidesz and KDNP parties hold more than half of the seats, if they decide to boycott the committee, they can prevent it from performing its job. This has already happened on several occasions when the committee was supposed to look into surveillance cases which would potentially have been politically unfeasible for the government.&rdquo; </blockquote>
<p>The lack of contestation and social debate around the issues of privacy and human rights in relations to projects such as the Hungarian Government&rsquo;s Dragonfly is striking. While information about the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> has sporadically reached the wider public <strong>any discussion of face recognition technologies employed by the HKR App has been missing</strong>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Effects of the technologies</h2>
<p><strong>State operated and centralised mass surveillance systems</strong>, such as the <a>Dragonfly Project</a> currently under development in Hungary, bring up at least two sets of questions with regard to their societal and political effects. The first set of questions concerns <strong>visibility and the (lack of) possibility for societal debate and contestation</strong>. The second concerns the <strong>grey areas of legislations and regulations</strong>. When the development and employment of such novel technologies as biometric video surveillance and (live) facial recognition becomes <strong>entangled with the national interest</strong> of reinforcing public order, preventing terrorism, and fighting criminality, or, as with the <a>Home Quarantine App</a>, reinforcing Coronavirus measures, their ability to carry out effective oversight might be seriously compromised. The Hungarian Governmental Decree from 16 March 2020 is a case in point. While the decree authorises the Minister for Innovation and Technology and an operational body consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Interior, the police, and health authorities to &ldquo;<strong>acquire and process any kind of personal data from private or public entities,</strong> including traffic and location data from telecommunication providers, <strong>with a very broad definition of the purpose for which the data can be used</strong>&rdquo; (Council of Europe 2020, 12) at the same time ordinary courts have been suspended, thus preventing the Constitutional Court from reviewing the proportionality of measures introduced under emergency conditions (Ibid 10). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Using such technologies for the so-called public good can even attract the <strong>support of residents</strong> who want to live in safe and predictable environments. The fact that these public environments are &ldquo;secured&rdquo; at the expense of <strong>curtailing the human rights to privacy and to one&rsquo;s face and biometric data</strong> is often overlooked by the public. As the human right NGO &ldquo;<a>Hungarian Civil Liberties Union</a>&rdquo; have put it in their recent publication:</p>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;[&hellip;] the introduction of facial recognition systems is almost never preceded by social debate. Its widespread application and the omission of public consultation can lead to the normalisation of continuous surveillance and a violation of rights, where states possess the ability of knowing where we go, whom we meet, what pubs or churches we visit.&rdquo;  </blockquote>
<p>To bring awareness to these issues, there is a need for a <strong>strong civil society and independent media</strong> which, if seriously compromised, as in the case of Hungary, can do little to educate the general public. Talking about the <strong>lack of legal framework</strong> with regard to the use of face recognition technologies by the Hungarian Secret Services &Aacute;d&aacute;m Remport explained:</p>
</section>
<section>
<blockquote>&ldquo;If there was oversight, I think that the use of these technologies would be probably more accepted. There&rsquo;s certainly a <strong>possibility for abuses</strong>. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that these abuses happen, first of all because it&rsquo;s impossible to prove them, and second, we have no direct evidence of them. This needs to be emphasised. But <strong>in reality, it only depends on the personal good will of the secret services not to breach individual&rsquo;s privacy rights</strong>. Because in the end there&rsquo;s no viable or independent oversight over their workings. They can go by the rules, and most of the times they probably do. Unless they don&rsquo;t. But then, <strong>we will never find out</strong>.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p><strong>1. The EU should prohibit the deployment of both indiscriminate and &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; Remote Biometric and Behavioural Identification (RBI) technologies in public spaces (real-time RBI), as well as ex-post identification (or forensic RBI). Our analysis shows that both practices, even when used for &ldquo;targeted surveillance&rdquo; amount to mass surveillance.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>In line with similar recommendations made by the EDPB and the EDPS,<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn45" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>45</sup></a> the EU should <strong>prohibit the deployment of Remote Biometric and Behavioural Identification technologies in public spaces</strong></p></li>
  <li><p>In line with the position of the EDRi regarding&rsquo;s EU Artificial Intelligence Act<a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu#fn46" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>46</sup></a>, our research supports the notion that the <strong>distinction between "real-time&rdquo; and &ldquo;ex-post&rdquo; is irrelevant</strong> when it comes to the impact of these technologies on fundamental rights. Ex-post identification carries in fact a higher potential of harm, as more data can be pooled from different sources to proceed to the identification. The use of such technologies for <strong>&ldquo;targeted surveillance&rdquo; is thus equally harmful</strong> as the practice might be considered as expansive and intrusive to an extent that it would constitute disproportionate interference with the rights to privacy and personal data protection.</p></li>
  <li><p>This concerns not only the acquisition and processing of <strong>faces, but also gait, voice and other biometric or behavioural signals.</strong></p></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>2. The EU should strengthen transparency and accountability of biometric and behavioural recognition technologies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our research found that the majority of surveillance systems remain opaque. There is very <strong>little information on how citizens' data is processed</strong> when they enter surveilled public spaces. Rarely are <strong>concrete alternatives</strong> provided if they do not wish to be surveilled. In some extreme cases, such as the deployment of FRT trials in London, citizens who deliberately avoided surveillance by covering their faces were <strong>subjected to fines</strong>. This poses considerable challenges to citizens&rsquo; rights, as well as to transparency and accountability of these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It seems thus necessary to expand existing transparency and accountability requirements</strong> in the new EU Artificial Intelligence Act for biometric technologies. These requirements should be expanded to include external independent accountability, transparency and oversight for any implementations of biometric technologies that are not already prohibited by the Act.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, it seems imperative to increase the transparency of such systems, by conditioning their operation to the publication of <strong>key characteristics and features</strong> (type of data acquisition, type of machine learning algorithm, nature of data collected in the database) necessary for <strong>effective public oversight</strong> of their operation. These details should be disclosed even when deployments are used for national security or law enforcement purposes, and the public should be informed about planned and ongoing projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The EU should promote the reinforcement of robust accountability mechanisms for biometric surveillance systems.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current legislative framework remains <strong>unclear</strong> as to which institutions may <strong>review or authorise biometric surveillance</strong> systems. In light of the GDPR and the LED, the Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) in some member states enforce the relevant data protection legislation and oversee the processing of biometric data, while in others a separate authority is tasked with the responsibility to review the compatibility with the relevant legislation insofar as personal data processing by law enforcement authorities is concerned (such as Belgium, see case study).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU should work toward developing a <strong>centralised authorisation process for biometric surveillance</strong>, within which all relevant authorities are included and are able to veto the authorisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act limits a prior authorisation by a court or independent administrative authority to &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; biometric surveillance, it is necessary to underline that ex-post biometric identification systems must be subject to supervision or authorisation taking into account the standards under the ECHR and the Charter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. The EU should promote individual rights under the GDPR through the promotion of digital-rights-by-design technologies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>More attention could be given to protect <strong>individuals&rsquo; rights under GDPR</strong> when it comes to data collection and processing mechanisms as well as a <strong>fundamental rights assessment</strong> ex ante and <strong>ex post.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>This could be implemented technically through <strong>data minimisation or digital rights-by-design</strong> methods, either through <strong>technical solutions that do not collect biometric information</strong>, or systems which incorporate automated forms of <strong>notification</strong>, <strong>immutable</strong> <strong>transparency and accountability logging</strong>, and <strong>control of data</strong> or ideally by a combination of both approaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. The EU should ensure effective enforcement of GDPR purpose limitation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose limitation</strong> is one of the key principles of the GDPR. As our report shows, the <strong>re-purposing of biometric data</strong> is not always kept sufficiently in check.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>From a technical perspective, <strong>biometric mass surveillance can easily emerge by connecting different elements of a technical infrastructure</strong> (video acquisition capacities, processing algorithms, biometric datasets) <strong>developed in other contexts.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For example, while the <strong>forensic use of facial recognition</strong> is not a form of <strong>remote biometric identification</strong> per se, the adoption of such systems has allowed for the creation of biometrically searchable national datasets. These datasets are one piece of a potential <strong>biometric mass surveillance</strong> infrastructure which can become a technical reality if live camera feeds, processed through live facial recognition software is connected to them.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to maintain democratic oversight over the uses of the infrastructure, and <strong>avoid the risk of function creep</strong> (i.e. when a technology is being used beyond its initial purpose) it is thus imperative that the principle of <strong>purpose limitation</strong> is systematically enforced and strictly regulated with regard to the <strong>type of data</strong> (criminal or civilian datasets, datasets generated from social media, as in the <a>Clearview AI</a> controversy) against which biometric searches can be performed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. The EU should support voices and organisations which are mobilised for the respect of EU fundamental rights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our research showed that, in addition to state oversight agencies, many institutions from <strong>civil society</strong> are active in making sure that <strong>EU fundamental rights are respected</strong> in the field of biometric security technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>While in some countries they benefit from a <strong>dense network of civil society funding</strong>, in others they are subjected to <strong>heavy scrutiny and financial restrictions</strong> (see for example the Hungary case study in this report).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting civil society organisations</strong> that operate in the <strong>sector of digital rights</strong> is therefore instrumental for a healthy democratic debate and oversight. Civil society needs to be able to participate in all relevant legislative and other decision-making procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Particularly in the area of <strong>litigation</strong>, support for civil society and EU citizens access to rights could be extremely helpful. We have found numerous areas in our study where sufficient legal clarity was lacking and would likely only take place through the courts. We would thus advise that the EU support existing <strong>digital rights litigation initiatives</strong> and create additional mechanisms to support this approach.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. The EU should take into account the global dimension of the Biometric and Behavioural Analysis Technology Industry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The technologies used for FRT in Europe come from <strong>vendors across the world</strong>. Technologies for biometric or behavioural analysis are often tested in one country before they are implemented in another.</p></li>
<li><p>EU policy on the biometric or behavioural analysis technology industry thus needs to consider its impact both <strong>inside and outside of Europe</strong>. Here, the recently revised <strong>EU Export Control framework</strong> which may include biometric and behavioural technologies can play a role.</p></li>

<article>





<p>When I was eight years old, I had a profound realization: once you know how to read, it&rsquo;s impossible not to. If you see the letters c-h-a-i-r in sequence, your mind conjures sit-able 4-legged furniture. You don&rsquo;t choose to read or not read, you just do it. And it&rsquo;s impossible to understand what it&rsquo;s like not to be able to read.</p>
<p>The same principle applies when learning how to code. Once you understand how it works, it&rsquo;s extreamly challenging to imagine not understanding it. This can be problematic when teaching because it creates a gap between teacher and student. Even the most empathetic teachers can&rsquo;t quite imagine themselves in a student&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>Getting a student from naivety to mastery takes a lot of work from the student and the teacher. But the work is asymmetrical. As a teacher, your role is to accompany, you can&rsquo;t walk the student&rsquo;s path for them. All you can do is support them through the journey as best you can.</p>
<p>This article is intended to share some techniques I&rsquo;ve developed for teaching debugging in a one-on-one setting. If you find this useful, let me know, and I&rsquo;ll write another one about helping students who are pair programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">Forget about the program, focus on the programmer <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#forget-about-the-program-focus-on-the-programmer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>Most programmers enjoy programming, and love solving a good problem. When you&rsquo;re helping a student write a program, you have to fight the urge to fix the problem. Forget the program is even there. You may just want hop through a few files and figure out what&rsquo;s going on. Stop. Fight that urge.</p>
<p>While it can be marginally helpful for a student to see you at work, it&rsquo;s not nearly as useful as it would be to help them solve the problem. You&rsquo;re not there to get the code to work&mdash;that would be consulting. You&rsquo;re there to get the <em>programmer</em> to work.</p>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/debugging/river.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>As programmers we construct an abstract mental model of the program we&rsquo;re writing. Bugs are discrepancies between our mental model of the program and the program itself. The program is doing something we don&rsquo;t <em>expect</em>. The program isn&rsquo;t <em>wrong</em>. The program can&rsquo;t be wrong. It&rsquo;s doing what it&rsquo;s been told to do. What&rsquo;s incorrect is our mental model. Once we understand the current state of the program, we can adjust it.</p>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/debugging/model.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>The art of debugging is systematically and creatively synchronizing the mental model with the actual program.</p>
<p>As you teach, your focus should be on the student&rsquo;s ability to keep the two in sync, not your own.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">Don&rsquo;t let them overheat <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#don't-let-them-overheat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>Debugging can be frustrating. Every programmer knows the difference between productive friction and wheel-spinning. Your student can&rsquo;t always tell the two apart. It&rsquo;s your job to keep an eye on their frustration level, and adjust your support strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>Consider both the frustration level of the student and the instructional value the moment offers.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re getting stuck on some tiny little problem, and the answer&rsquo;s starring them right in the face, just fix it for them. It&rsquo;s not worth pulling out the socratic method to fix a missing comma.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re profoundly frustrated, even if the moment offers tremendous instructional potential, hit pause. Take care of the human being in front of you. The programming concepts can come later.</p>
<p><img src="https://offbyone.us/img/debugging/matrix.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Depending on the level of trust you&rsquo;ve built up with the student, you may be able to teach through more frustration than you would with a brand new student.</p>
<p>So, You&rsquo;ve identified a strategy. But how do you teach, how do you support and how do you debug?</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">How to teach <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#how-to-teach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>Try to ask questions more often than you give information. It&rsquo;s totally fine if you tell students things here and there, but try to lead them to answers whenever possible. I&rsquo;ve found that sometimes I can deliberately slow down my own thought processes, and shield myself from what I think is the right answer. By doing this, I&rsquo;m able to pose questions that I don&rsquo;t know the answer to (&ldquo;I wonder what the state of the user record is right now?&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re teaching in person, avoid touching a student&rsquo;s keyboard. When I was new to teaching, I would sit on my hands so I wouldn&rsquo;t be tempted to take over. If you need to show an example of something, use your own computer.</p>
<p>Offer lots of encouragement. Every idea is a good idea. If they&rsquo;re at risk of rabat-holing, gently coax them out of it with a question, observation, or suggestion, for example, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a great thought&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to find the answer there&hellip; tell me, do you think this code <em>ever</em> runs? I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if the problem is upstream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you get a sense of closure on a topic, prompt the student to summarize what they&rsquo;ve learned. Finding the right time to summarize isn&rsquo;t totally cut and dry, but I&rsquo;ll offer two metaphors. When the &ldquo;mental callstack&rdquo; is empty, summarize. When get that feeling like &ldquo;I should make a git commit,&rdquo; summarize. Students sometimes get overwhelmed by the details, and if they never take a step back and appreciate the forest, all they&rsquo;ll remember are trees.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">How to debug <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#how-to-debug" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve decided that the best course of action is to take over and solve a student&rsquo;s problem for them. The way you do it matters. You want to make sure you&rsquo;re honoring the weight of the problem. They&rsquo;re not stupid for not getting it. Show them that even professional programers get stuck, and that there&rsquo;s a methodology for getting unstuck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that they can follow along. You might be making certain observations--voice them, and then check to see that they&rsquo;re with you (&ldquo;oh, it <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be a problem in the checkout service because we haven&rsquo;t even passed validation, yet&hellip; do you agree?&rdquo;). Make lots of diagrams.</p>
<p>Practice good hygiene. Even if you might throw a bunch of random logs all over the place when you&rsquo;re coding alone, try to demonstrate best practices. You don&rsquo;t want to model your own bad habits.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s fixed, go over everything again. Talk about what the problem was, how we figured it out, and how we fixed it. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, check and make sure they&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">How to support <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#how-to-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>Some moments are &ldquo;teachable&rdquo; and some aren&rsquo;t. Learning to code is hard, and you will find students who are so frustrated or anxious that they can&rsquo;t learn. This isn&rsquo;t the time to pivot to your favorite debugging technique. Instead, be there for them. Hear their concerns and anxieties, and let them know that they&rsquo;ll get through it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a setting around other students, take them aside. It can be hard to have a vulnerable conversation in public. Maybe take a walk or go into another room.</p>
<p>The most important thing you can do is listen. Ask them what&rsquo;s bothering them. Make sure they know that you heard them by repeating it back in your own words. If you don&rsquo;t have it right, keep working at it until you do.</p>
<p>Lots of early stage programmers don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s <em>normal</em> to struggle. They may not be aware that you had analogous struggles. While this isn&rsquo;t about you&mdash;it&rsquo;s about them&mdash;it can be helpful to tell them about the ways you struggled while you were learning, and the ways you struggle today.</p>
<p>It can be hard for students to grasp the progress they&rsquo;re making when they&rsquo;re in a rut. At times, I&rsquo;ve pulled up prior work from the student and emphasized the growth they&rsquo;re making. &ldquo;I know how frustrating this is. I just want you to know that you&rsquo;re growing, and I see that. See this? You wrote this two months ago. I bet you&rsquo;d do it totally differently today. What about this? You did this last week, you couldn&rsquo;t do that two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a break is almost always necessary before diving back into the IDE.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1">Putting it all together <a aria-hidden="true" href="https://offbyone.us#putting-it-all-together" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<p>You can mix and match these techniques. You can throw some out and add your own. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be 100% one and 0% the others. You&rsquo;re not a machine. Every teacher and every student is different. The art of teaching is finding a technique that works for the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s working? Ask your students. &ldquo;When we took a walk and talked through things, was that helpful?&rdquo; &ldquo;When I ask you all these questions as you&rsquo;re coding, do you find that useful? I sensed some frustration.&rdquo; Just like you can&rsquo;t know the state of an application without a breakpoint or log statement, you can&rsquo;t know the state of your students without talking to them. What they say may surprise you, and it&rsquo;s important for fine tuning your craft.</p>

It will submit its report in two months.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>In announcing their decision, the judges criticised the government&rsquo;s refusal to divulge, on the grounds of national security, any details of what the software was used for and why. They said Delhi had offered &ldquo;only a vague &hellip; denial of allegations&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;The state cannot get a free pass every time by raising national security concerns. No omnibus prohibition can be called against judicial review,&rdquo; the judges said.</p><p>Siddharth Varadarajan, the founder-editor of India&rsquo;s non-profit the Wire website that has worked with the Guardian on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Pegasus project</a>, welcomed the decision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good start. The supreme court has rightly refused to buy the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;national security&rsquo; logic,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The opposition in India has accused the Narendra Modi government of treason and &ldquo;unforgivable sacrilege&rdquo; over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/19/nso-clients-spying-disclosures-prompt-political-rows-across-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports from the Pegasus project</a> revealing that several journalists, activists, and an election strategist had their phone numbers included in a data leak of more than 50,000 numbers.</p><p>The stories revealed details of hundreds of verified Indian phone numbers that appear in the leaked records of numbers and include that of the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pegasus-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Pegasus project</a>, an investigation into the Israeli spyware maker, NSO Group, was led by a consortium of 17 news outlets that included the Guardian, Washington Post and the French nonprofit Forbidden Stories.</p><p>NSO has said its hacking software is only meant to be used by government clients to conduct legitimate investigations into serious crime. The company has said it conducts thorough investigations of allegations of misuse when it receives &ldquo;credible information&rdquo;.</p><p>The Indian government has said very little on the scandal, largely confining itself to accusing those making the allegations of trying to discredit the country and malign Indian democracy with their &ldquo;anti-India agenda&rdquo;.</p><p>During earlier hearings, the government had offered to form its own panel of experts but this was rejected on Wednesday by the judges, who began the hearing by noting the &ldquo;Orwellian concerns&rdquo; about the misuse of technology.</p><p>The judges said indiscriminate spying could not be allowed and highlighted the &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; effect it could have on freedom of speech and freedom of the press.</p><p>They were compelled, they added, to &ldquo;determine the truth and get to the bottom of the issue&rdquo;.</p></div></div>]]></content>

<p>JACK:	Hey, I can&rsquo;t believe we made it to Episode 100.  Seriously, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without all the support from my listeners so truly, thank you so much for tuning in.  This has been amazing and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the next 100 episodes brings.  Okay, so real quick before we get started, this is the second part of a two-part episode.  If you haven&rsquo;t already, go back and listen to the episode just before this, number 99, called The Spy.  [MUSIC] There&rsquo;s this malware called Magic Lantern and I find it fascinating.  It usually infects a computer through an e-mail attachment.  You get the e-mail which says to open the attachment and when you do, zang; your computer is infected.  What Magic Lantern does is it records your keystrokes and sends everything you type back to a central system so the hackers can see everything you type.  Now, of course with a keystroke logger like this, it can pick up any message you send to people; private chats and of course, your passwords.  So, who&rsquo;s this shady hacking group that uses Magic Lantern?</p>

  <p><span>Jabbar Collins languished</span> in jail for over 16 years for a murder he apparently never committed. He was only freed a few years ago when it was revealed at a post-conviction hearing that the main witness at his trial had told the prosecutor that he was pressured by police to lie about Collins&rsquo; involvement in the murder.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, representing the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s office, never shared that information with Collins&rsquo; lawyer&mdash;an egregious violation of the law, which requires the government to inform the defense of any exculpatory evidence. At the hearing, the judge who tossed out Collins&rsquo; conviction called the conduct of the prosecutor and the DA&rsquo;s office &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; and a &ldquo;tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been a federal district judge for the past 23 years sitting in the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. I have sentenced murderers, rapists, gangsters, drug lords, stock cheats, and just about every other type of criminal, but they were all clearly guilty of their crimes and I was able to sleep at night knowing that they deserved to be sitting in jail&mdash;some for the rest of their lives. I do lose sleep, however, over the Collins case and the rash of wrongful convictions that are continuing to be uncovered to this date in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The Collins case turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. Soon many other wrongful convictions, orchestrated by other Brooklyn prosecutors, began to surface. It became a huge scandal and a black mark against the criminal justice system in Brooklyn. It also animated a crusading civil rights lawyer named Ken Thompson to campaign against and defeat a 20-plus-year incumbent, making Thompson the first African-American district attorney in Brooklyn&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>When Thompson took over a few years ago, he appointed a blue-ribbon committee to investigate all the alleged wrongful convictions the DA&rsquo;s office had obtained throughout the years. So far, over 20 cases have been unearthed&mdash;almost all against poor African Americans.Many others are still being investigated. The phony cases have run the gamut from prosecutors not turning over exculpatory evidence (as in Collins&rsquo; case), to using false testimony from the same supposed eye-witness in at least three unrelated cases.</p>

<p>After Collins was released, he brought a civil case seeking monetary damages against his prosecutor, the district attorney, and the City of New York. I was the judge who drew that case. I held that the City could be held liable for its misdeeds but I had to dismiss the case against the prosecutor and district attorney on the grounds of prosecutorial immunity. In my decision, I quoted the binding circuit court precedent I was duty-bound to follow.</p>

<p>According to <em>Taylor v. Kavanagh</em>, based upon Supreme Court law, &ldquo;The falsification of evidence and the coercion of witnesses...have been held to be prosecutorial activities for which absolute immunity applies. Similarly, because a prosecutor is acting as an advocate in a judicial proceeding, the solicitation and subornation of perjured testimony, the withholding of evidence, or the introduction of illegally-seized evidence at trial does not create liability in damages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The law goes on to say that the rationale for this approach is &ldquo;sound, for these protected activities, while deplorable, involve decisions of judgment affecting the course of a prosecution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I question the soundness of this rationale, however. The &ldquo;solicitation and subornation of perjured testimony, the withholding of evidence, or the introduction of illegally-seized evidence at trial&rdquo; are not &ldquo;decisions of judgment;&rdquo; they are truly &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo; intentional acts&mdash;the antithesis of the exercise of judgment. Professional prosecutors, charged with the awesome responsibility of faithfully applying the law to guard against innocent people being convicted of crimes they did not commit, should be held accountable for such conduct.</p>

      
    


<p>Because of the present status of the law, the prosecutors responsible for the wrongful convictions have neither been held criminally nor civilly responsible for their shameful conduct. Also troubling, taxpayers have had to foot the bill for millions of dollars in settlements from New York City and the State of New York, which are on the hook for the prosecutors&rsquo; misdeeds, and more are undoubtedly in the hopper. Collins settled his case for $13 million. Ron Kuby, the civil rights lawyer who represented a number of the wrongfully convicted in Brooklyn, recently told me that he believes the government has so far paid out between $300 million and $400 million.</p>

<p>And the problem of wrongful convictions is not endemic to Brooklyn. For example, just a few years ago Senator Ted Stevens&rsquo; conviction was overturned because of egregious behavior by two overzealous prosecutors for the Justice Department. And there have been many recently reported in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the time has come to create some level of accountability for prosecutors.</p>

<p>First, the cloak of absolute immunity should judicially or legislatively be lifted. Police officers do not have it and they are held accountable in courts of law for their egregious behavior. We wisely do not give our law enforcement officers, or even the President, carte blanche to do as they please; bad prosecutors should similarly be accountable.</p>

<p>Second, steps can be taken by the legal establishment to punish such behavior. All prosecutors are lawyers and their licenses to practice law require them to abide by legally prescribed canons of ethics enforceable by the bar and the courts. Admirably, just a few months ago, the Indiana Supreme Court suspended the chief deputy prosecutor of LaPorte County, Indiana from the practice of law for a minimum of four years with no automatic right of reinstatement for eavesdropping on an attorney-client conversation. As in Collins&rsquo; case, the court described this conduct as &ldquo;deplorable.&rdquo; Other states should follow this lead.</p>

<p>Third, prosecutors who intentionally withhold exculpatory evidence resulting in a wrongful conviction should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. The good ones need not be concerned, but the bad &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo; ones should know that there might be civil, and even criminal, consequences for misconduct.</p>

<p>We all hold dear to the time-honored notion that &ldquo;no one is above the law.&rdquo; Truly horrendous prosecutors who have put innocent people in jail should not be an exception.</p>

<p><em>Frederic Block is a federal district judge for the Eastern District of New York. In 2012 he published his memoir Disrobed, An Inside Look at the Life and Work of a Federal Trial Judge. His &ldquo;reality-fiction&rdquo; novel Race to Judgment was recently released based in part on the rise of Ken Thompson, the Collins case, and the wrongfully convicted.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Key Findings</strong></h3>
<ul><li><em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ben-hubbard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">journalist Ben Hubbard</a> was repeatedly targeted with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware over a three-year period from June 2018 to June 2021. The targeting took place while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia, and writing a book about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</li>
<li>The targeting resulted in Pegasus infections in July 2020 and June 2021. Notably, these infections occurred <i>after </i>Hubbard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/reader-center/phone-hacking-saudi-arabia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>complained</span></a><span> to NSO Group that he was </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">targeted by</a> the Saudi-linked <b><i>KINGDOM</i></b> Pegasus operator in June 2018.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>While we attribute the 2020 and 2021 infections to NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware with high confidence, we are not conclusively attributing this activity to a specific NSO Group customer at this time. However, we believe that the operator responsible for the 2021 hack is also responsible for the </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>hacking of a Saudi activist in 2021</span></a><span>.</span><span><br></span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Some forensic artifacts that we connect to NSO Group are present on Hubbard&rsquo;s device as early as April 2018, although we are unable to confirm whether this represents a genuine infection attempt or a feasibility test.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A phone number belonging to Hubbard also reportedly </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/18/world/middleeast/israel-nso-pegasus-spyware.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>appeared</span></a><span> on the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Pegasus Project list</span></a><span> in July 2019. Unfortunately, forensic evidence is not available for this timeframe.</span></li>
</ul><h3><b>1. Background: NSO Group&rsquo;s Zero-Click iPhone Hacking Capabilities</b></h3>
<p><span>Multiple reports indicate that NSO Group has used and demonstrated zero-click iPhone exploits since at least 2017. A </span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-company-negotiated-to-sell-advanced-cybertech-to-the-saudis-1.6680618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Haaretz story</span></a><span> cited a June 2017 zero-click iPhone demo to the Saudi Government, and a </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvakb3/inside-nso-group-spyware-demo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>2018 Motherboard article</span></a><span> described a different zero-click iPhone demonstration. Meanwhile, in 2019, WhatsApp </span><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/protecting-our-users-from-a-video-calling-cyber-attack/?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>announced</span></a><span> that NSO Group had been exploiting WhatsApp video calling functionality to conduct </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>zero-click infections of Android devices</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Winter 2019: iMessage Zero-Click Activity</b></h4>
<p><span>We first observed a Pegasus zero-click attack directed against an iPhone in December 2019 when we began running VPNs on the phones of potentially targeted users. We were not able to recover any logs from the targeted phone at that time, so we are unsure of the precise exploit used.</span></p>
<h4><b>Summer 2020: The </b><b><i>KISMET</i></b><b> Exploit (iOS 13.5.1 and iOS 13.7)</b></h4>
<p><span>This was followed by the </span><b><i>KISMET</i></b><span> zero-click exploit which NSO customers </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>widely deployed</span></a><span> starting in July 2020 against iOS 13.5.1 and later against iOS 13.7. The iOS14 update apparently blocked exploitation of </span><b><i>KISMET</i></b><span>.</span></p>
<h4><b>2021: The </b><b><i>FORCEDENTRY</i></b><b> Exploit (iOS 14.x until 14.7.1)</b></h4>
<p><span>NSO Group customers began using the </span><b><i>FORCEDENTRY</i></b><span> exploit as early as February 2021. NSO Group customers were continuing to deploy </span><b><i>FORCEDENTRY</i></b><span> against iPhones running iOS versions through 14.7.1 as of September 2021. We </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>captured</span></a><span> the </span><b><i>FORCEDENTRY</i></b><span> exploit and disclosed it to Apple in September 2021. Apple patched </span><b><i>FORCEDENTRY</i></b><span> in iOS 14.8, six days after our disclosure. Amnesty Tech </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>also saw</span></a><span> traces associated with this exploit during forensic analyses they performed as part of the Pegasus Project.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. The 2021 Pegasus Hack of Ben Hubbard</strong></h3>
<p><em>We conclude with high confidence that an iPhone belonging to Hubbard was successfully hacked with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware on <strong>June 13, 2021</strong>, with the infection process starting around <strong>15:45:20 GMT</strong>.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Details from Hack of Saudi Activist</strong></h4>
<p>We <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>recovered</span></a> the <em><strong>FORCEDENTRY</strong></em> exploit from a backup of a Saudi activist&rsquo;s iPhone. The <em><strong>FORCEDENTRY</strong></em> exploit was delivered to the Saudi activist&rsquo;s phone in 31 iMessage attachments sent from the iMessage account <em><strong>[EMAIL ADDRESS 1]</strong></em>, based on an analysis of the activist&rsquo;s phone logs, including their <em>com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist</em> file. The <em><strong>FORCEDENTRY</strong></em> exploit was <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>used to deploy</span></a> NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware onto the phone of the Saudi activist, and this process involved a file dropped into the <em>Library/Caches</em> folder.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hubbard-Image-1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hubbard-Image-1.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 1: The FORCEDENTRY exploit on the phone of the Saudi activist.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We believe that iMessage accounts used to deliver Pegasus, like <em><strong>[EMAIL ADDRESS 1]</strong><span>,</span></em> are used exclusively for this purpose, as other elements of NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus infrastructure, such as infection servers and command-and-control servers, are used exclusively in relation to Pegasus and not for any other uses.</p>
<h4><strong>Similarities between Hubbard&rsquo;s Phone and Phone of Saudi Activist</strong></h4>
<p>Hubbard&rsquo;s <em>com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist</em> file shows that the same iMessage account <em><strong>[EMAIL ADDRESS 1]</strong></em> communicated with his phone at <em><strong>June 13, 2021</strong> <strong>15:45:20 GMT</strong></em>, about five minutes before a file was dropped in or deleted from the <em>Library/Caches</em> folder, and at least 41 iMessage attachments were deleted. Additionally, three items were deleted from Hubbard&rsquo;s <em>DataUsage.sqlite</em> file, leaving a gap in the sequence of <em>Z_PK</em> values in the <em>ZPROCESS</em> table. The deleted items all had timestamps greater than June 9, 2021 11:56:46 GMT and less than June 16, 2021 8:46:17 GMT. Based on this pattern of facts, we conclude with high confidence that Hubbard&rsquo;s iPhone was hacked with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware on <strong>June 13,</strong> <em><strong>2021</strong> <strong>15:45:20 GMT</strong></em>.</p>
<h3><strong>3. The 2020 Pegasus Hack of Ben Hubbard</strong></h3>
<p><em>We conclude with high confidence that an iPhone belonging to Hubbard was successfully hacked with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware on <strong>July 12,</strong> <strong>2020</strong>, with the infection process starting around <strong>16:46:01 GMT</strong>.</em></p>
<h4><b><i>DataUsage.sqlite</i></b><b> Artifact</b></h4>
<p><span>We found that Ben Hubbard&rsquo;s </span><i><span>DataUsage.sqlite</span></i><span> file showed that process name </span><i><span>bh</span></i><span> was active on </span><b><i>July 13, 2020 16:46:01</i></b><span>. This process name is consistent with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware, which uses the </span><i><span>bh</span></i><span> process name apparently as an </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>abbreviation for</span></a><span> &ldquo;bridgehead</span>,&rdquo;<span> which appears to be a term of art referring to an initial stage of a malicious payload. A subsequent backup of Hubbard&rsquo;s phone taken in July 2021 (after the 2021 Pegasus hack of his phone) shows that this </span><i><span>bh</span></i><span> entry was deleted from </span><i><span>DataUsage.sqlite</span></i><span>, leaving a gap in the sequence of </span><i><span>Z_PK</span></i><span> values in the </span><i><span>ZPROCESS</span></i><span> table.</span></p>
<p><span>We found that attachments for at least 13 iMessages were deleted at July 12, 2020 16:45:55, several seconds before the </span><i><span>DataUsage.sqlite</span></i><span> artifact, indicating iMessage as the likely vector for Pegasus in this case. NSO Group customers were widely deploying the </span><b><i>KISMET</i></b><span> zero-click iMessage exploit at this time to hack target phones.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>HIPPOCRENE FACTOR</i></b><b> Present on Hubbard&rsquo;s Phone</b></h4>
<p><span>Hubbard&rsquo;s phone logs show a sign of Pegasus infection that we call the </span><b><i>HIPPOCRENE FACTOR</i></b><span>. A careful analysis of Hubbard&rsquo;s logs indicates that the </span><b><i>HIPPOCRENE FACTOR</i></b><span> was introduced onto Hubbard&rsquo;s phone sometime after January 29, 2020 and before December 14, 2020. We have attributed the </span><b><i>HIPPOCRENE FACTOR</i></b><span> to NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware with high confidence, though we are not describing additional technical details of the </span><b><i>HIPPOCRENE FACTOR</i></b><span> here, in order to maintain visibility into NSO Group&rsquo;s spyware.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. The 2018 Pegasus Artifacts on Hubbard&rsquo;s Phone</strong></h3>
<p><em>We conclude with high confidence that a Pegasus operator, <strong>KINGDOM</strong>, sent Hubbard SMS and WhatsApp messages in June 2018 containing links that, if clicked, would have infected his phone with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware. We also noted that an Apple account that we believe is linked to Pegasus contacted Hubbard&rsquo;s phone in April 2018, but we could not determine if this represented an infection attempt.</em></p>
<h4><strong>An Odd Email Address is Looked Up</strong></h4>
<p>The <em>com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist</em> files on Hubbard&rsquo;s phones records that an NSO Group system likely reached out to Hubbard&rsquo;s phone on <strong>April 4, 2018</strong> using Apple&rsquo;s <em>Thumper</em> cloud calling feature. The outreach was via an Apple account with the email address <em><strong>[EMAIL ADDRESS 2]</strong></em>. It is presently unclear if this outreach was a <em>bona fide</em> hacking attempt, or simply a targeted feasibility test to see whether Hubbard&rsquo;s phone <em>could have</em> been hacked with Pegasus.&#8232; Amnesty Tech <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>observed</span></a> that the presence of an unfamiliar email address looked up by the <em>Thumper</em> cloud calling feature was sometimes correlated with Pegasus hacking.</p>
<h4><em><strong>KINGDOM</strong></em> <strong>Pegasus Messages from 2018</strong></h4>
<p>We <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/01/stopping-the-press-new-york-times-journalist-targeted-by-saudi-linked-pegasus-spyware-operator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>previously documented</span></a> that Hubbard received a Pegasus SMS on <strong>June 21, 2018</strong> from <em><strong>KINGDOM</strong></em>, a Pegasus operator that we link to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with high confidence. Though NSO Group issued an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/reader-center/phone-hacking-saudi-arabia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>off-the-record denial</span></a> that the link sent to Hubbard was related to them, we still connect the link to NSO Group with high confidence. Hubbard&rsquo;s phone also shows a <em><strong>KINGDOM</strong></em> Pegasus WhatsApp message sent on June 2, 2018 8:54:42 PM GMT (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The message is largely identical to a Pegasus message targeted at <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/07/nso-spyware-targeting-amnesty-international/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>an Amnesty International staffer</span></a> in 2018.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Hubbard was repeatedly subjected to targeted hacking with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware. The hacking took place after the very public reporting in 2020 by Hubbard and the Citizen Lab that he had been a target. The case starkly illustrates the dissonance between NSO Group&rsquo;s stated concerns for human rights and oversight, and the reality: it appears that no effective steps were taken by the company to prevent the repeated targeting of a prominent American journalist&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>The hacking of a <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo; reporter adds to a long list of documented cases of journalists being targeted or hacked using NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware:</p>
<ul><li>In December 2020, the Citizen Lab published a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> outlining how the personal phones belonging to 36 journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at <em>Al Jazeera</em>, and a personal phone of a journalist at London-based <em>Al Araby TV</em>, were hacked with Pegasus spyware.</li>
<li>Amnesty International&rsquo;s Security Lab <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/the-pegasus-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>verified</span></a> that Sevinc Vaqifqizi, a freelance journalist for independent media outlet Meydan TV, had his phone infected with Pegasus in early 2021.</li>
<li>Amnesty also confirmed that the devices of Siddharth Varadarajan and MK Venu, co-founders of India&rsquo;s <em>the Wire</em>, were infected with Pegasus as recently as June 2021.</li>
<li>On August 2, 2021, French intelligence investigators <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/aug/02/pegasus-spyware-found-on-journalists-phones-french-intelligence-confirms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>confirmed</span></a> that forensic traces associated with NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware had been detected on three French journalists&rsquo; phones.</li>
<li>In September 2021, the Citizen Lab confirmed that the phone of D&aacute;niel N&eacute;meth, a photojournalist working out of Budapest, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/21/hungary-journalist-daniel-nemeth-phones-infected-with-nso-pegasus-spyware" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>also</span></a> hacked with Pegasus spyware, with the forensic analysis independently verified by Amnesty&rsquo;s Security Lab.</li>
<li>Prior Citizen Lab research has documented targeted espionage against journalists and civic media using Pegasus spyware in cases involving <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/10/the-kingdom-came-to-canada-how-saudi-linked-digital-espionage-reached-canadian-soil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Saudi Arabia</span></a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/03/nso-spyware-slain-journalists-wife/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Mexico</span></a>.</li>
</ul><p>The extensive and routine abuse of Pegasus spyware to hack journalists is a direct threat to press freedom worldwide, and is contributing to a growing chilling climate for investigative journalism. As a recent <a href="https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/spyware-an-unregulated-and-escalating-threat-to-independent-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> by the Center for International Media Assistance notes, &ldquo;[t]he use of spyware poses safety risks to journalists and their sources, encourages self-censorship, and creates new financial and operational strains for news outlets.&rdquo; Until steps are taken to rein in the mercenary commercial spyware marketplace, repressive governments will continue to exploit products like NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus spyware to undermine independent journalism that seeks to hold them to account.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New submitter apcyberax writes: A judge has ruled that security cameras and a Ring doorbell installed in a house in Oxfordshire "unjustifiably invaded" the privacy of a neighbour, in a case that could have implications for home surveillance devices. Dr Mary Fairhurst claimed that the devices installed on the house of neighbour Jon Woodard broke data laws and contributed to harassment. The judge upheld both these claims. Mr Woodard now faces a substantial fine. He claimed he installed the devices in good faith as a deterrent against burglars. 

The origin of the row stems from an invitation from Mr Woodard to his neighbour Dr Fairhurst to have a tour of his home renovations, during which she claimed he showed off his new security system. The judgement reads that Dr Fairhurst was "alarmed and appalled" to notice that he had a camera mounted on his shed and that footage from it was sent to his smartphone. A series of disputes about the cameras followed, which resulted in Dr Fairhurst moving out of her home. In the judgement it was found that the Ring doorbell captured images of the claimant's house and garden, while the shed camera covered almost the whole of her garden and her parking space.</p><p></p><div>

<p>Swarm is a 2D programming and resource gathering game. Program your
robots to explore the world and collect resources, which in turn
allows you to build upgraded robots that can run more interesting and
complex programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/blob/main/images/log.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/raw/main/images/log.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" loading="lazy"></a></p>
<p>The implementation is still in an early stage, but planned features
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practically infinite 2D procedurally generated worlds</li>
<li>Simple yet powerful programming language based on the polymorphic
lambda calculus + recursion, with a command monad for describing
first-class imperative actions</li>
<li>In-game tutorial</li>
<li>Multiple game modes:
<ul>
<li>In Classic mode, you start with the ability to produce only very
basic, limited robots; collecting resources allows you to
bootstrap your way into programming more sophisticated robots
that can explore more of the world, collect more resources, etc.</li>
<li>Hardcore mode is like Classic mode, but you start with only a
limited number of robots.  If they get stuck or you run out of
resources, it's game over!</li>
<li>Sandbox mode places no restrictions: program robots to your
heart's content using whatever language features you want,
without worrying about collecting resources.</li>
<li>In Challenge mode, you attempt to program robots in order to
solve pre-designed puzzles or challenges.</li>
<li>Future versions might also have multiplayer modes, with co-op or
PvP play over a network...?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Warning: Swarm is still in an early stage; it's missing many of the
planned features, there is no winning condition, and the gameplay is
not very deep yet.  But you can program cute little robots, and hey,
that's all that really matters, right?</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Swarm requires a POSIX-style environment that supports
<code>terminfo</code>.  On Linux and OSX, the below instructions should work
natively.  On Windows, see <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/issues/53" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the comments on this GitHub
issue</a> for instructions
getting it to work under the Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p>
<p>The recommended way to install Swarm at the moment is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clone the Swarm repository, e.g.</p>
<div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/byorgey/swarm.git
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don't already have the <code>stack</code> tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ghcup</code> tool</a>, a handy
one-stop utility for managing all the different pieces of a
Haskell toolchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>ghcup</code> to install <code>stack</code>:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended that you use a relatively large terminal window (<em>e.g.</em>
132 columns x 43 rows or larger).</p>
<ul>
<li>To find out the size of your terminal, you can type <code>stty size</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now use <code>stack</code> to build and run Swarm:</p>
<div><pre><code>cd /path/to/the/swarm/repo
stack run
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go get a snack while <code>stack</code> downloads a Haskell compiler and
all of Swarm's dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have fun! At the moment, you probably want to <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">take a look at the
tutorial</a> to help get you started.  Eventually there
will be an in-game tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/blob/main/COMMUNITY.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">COMMUNITY</a> page for ways to connect with
others in the community.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute, you're most welcome!  There are <em>lots</em> of
ways to contribute, regardless of your Haskell background.  For
example, even someone with no Haskell experience whatsoever could
still help with <em>e.g.</em> game design, playtesting, and level design for
challenge mode.  Check out the <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/swarm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CONTRIBUTING</a> file
for more specific information about how to contribute.</p>

We propose FAMHE, a novel federated analytics system that, based on multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE), enables privacy-preserving analyses of distributed datasets by yielding highly accurate results without revealing any intermediate data. We demonstrate the applicability of FAMHE to essential biomedical analysis tasks, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in oncology and genome-wide association studies in medical genetics. Using our system, we accurately and efficiently reproduce two published centralized studies in a federated setting, enabling biomedical insights that are not possible from individual institutions alone.

                <section><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>A key requirement for fully realizing the potential of precision medicine is to make large amounts of medical data interoperable and widely accessible to researchers. Today, however, medical data are scattered across many institutions, which renders centralized access and aggregation of such data challenging, if not impossible. The challenges are not due to the technical hurdles of transporting high volumes of heterogeneous data across organizations but to the legal and regulatory barriers that make the transfer of patient-level data outside a healthcare provider complex and time-consuming. Moreover, stringent data protection and privacy regulations (e.g., General Data-Protection Regulation (GDPR)<sup><a aria-label="Reference 1" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR1" title="European Commission.

Swarm learning as a privacy-preserving machine learning approach for disease classification. Nature 594, 265&ndash;270 (2021)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4</a></sup>. FA enables different healthcare providers to collaboratively perform statistical analyses and to develop machine-learning models, without exchanging the underlying datasets. Only aggregated results or model updates are transferred. In this way, each healthcare provider can define its own data governance and maintain control over the access to its patient-level data. FA offers opportunities for exploiting large and diverse volumes of data distributed across multiple institutions. These opportunities can facilitate the development and validation of artificial intelligence algorithms that yield more accurate, unbiased, and generalizable clinical recommendations, as well as accelerate novel discoveries. Such advances are particularly important in the context of rare diseases or medical conditions, where the number of affected patients in a single institution is often not sufficient to identify meaningful statistical patterns with enough statistical power.</p><p>The adoption of FA in the medical sector, despite its potential, has been slower than expected. This is in large part due to the unresolved privacy issues of FA, related to the sharing of model updates or partial data aggregates in cleartext. Indeed, despite patient-level data not being transferred between the institutions engaging in FA, it has been shown that the model updates (or partial aggregates) themselves can, under certain circumstances, leak sensitive personal information about the underlying individuals, thus leading to re-identification, membership inference, and feature reconstruction<sup><a aria-label="Reference 5" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR5" title="Zhu, L. &amp; Han, S.

Our work focuses on overcoming this key limitation of existing FA approaches. We note that limited data interoperability across different healthcare providers is another potential challenge in deploying FA; this, in practice, can be surmounted by harmonizing the data across institutions before performing the analysis.</p><p>Several open-source software platforms have recently been developed to provide users streamlined access to FA algorithms<sup><a aria-label="Reference 3" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR3" title="Nasirigerdeh, R. et al. sPLINK: a federated, privacy-preserving tool as a robust alternative to meta-analysis in genome-wide association studies.

These solutions use techniques such as differential privacy (diffP)<sup><a aria-label="Reference 25" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR25" title="Dwork, C. et al.

However, these techniques often achieve stronger privacy protection at the expense of accuracy or computational efficiency, thus limiting their applicability. Existing diffP techniques for FA, which prevent privacy leakage from the intermediate data by adding noise to it before sharing, often require prohibitive amounts of noise, which leads to inaccurate models. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus around how to set the privacy parameters for diffP in order to provide acceptable mitigation of inference risks in practice<sup><a aria-label="Reference 26" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR26" title="Jayaraman, B. &amp; Evans, D.

SMC and HE are cryptographic frameworks for securely performing computation over private datasets (pooled from multiple parties in the context of FA, in an encrypted form) without any intermediate leakage, but both come with notable drawbacks. SMC incurs a high network-communication overhead and has difficulty scaling to a large number of data providers (DPs). HE imposes high storage and computational overheads and introduces a single point of failure in the standard centralized setup, where a single party receives all encrypted datasets to securely perform the joint computation.

Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, (2021)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">28</a></sup>, to privacy-preserving FA, and we demonstrate its ability to enable efficient federated execution of two fundamental workflows in biomedical research: Kaplan&ndash;Meier survival analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). MHE is a recently proposed multiparty computation framework based on HE; it combines the power of HE to perform computation on encrypted data without communication between the parties, with the benefits of interactive protocols, which can simplify certain expensive HE operations. Building upon the MHE framework, we introduce an approach to FA, where each participating institution performs local computation and encrypts the intermediate results by using MHE; the results are then combined (e.g., aggregated) and distributed back to each institution for further computation. This process is repeated until the desired analysis is completed. Contrary to diffP-based approaches that rely on obfuscation techniques to mitigate the leakage in intermediate results, by sharing only encrypted intermediate results, FAMHE provides end-to-end privacy protection, without sacrificing accuracy. By sharing only encrypted information, our approach guarantees that, whenever needed, a minimum level of obfuscation can be applied only to the final result in order to protect it from inference attacks, instead of being applied to all intermediate results. Furthermore, FAMHE improves over both SMC and HE approaches by minimizing communication, by scaling to large numbers of DPs, and by circumventing expensive noninteractive operations (e.g., bootstrapping in HE). Our work also introduces a range of optimization techniques for FAMHE, including optimization of the local vs. collective computation balance, ciphertext packing strategies, and polynomial approximation of complex operations; these techniques are instrumental in our efficient design of FAMHE solutions for survival analysis and GWAS.</p><p>We demonstrate the performance of FAMHE by replicating two published multicentric studies that originally relied on data centralization.

In particular, by relying on MHE and on the distributed protocols for FA proposed by Froelicher et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 24" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR24" title="Froelicher, D. et al. Scalable privacy-preserving distributed learning. In Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, 323&ndash;347 (2021)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">24</a></sup>, our approach enables several sites to compute on their local patient-level data and then encrypt (Local Computation &amp; Encryption in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>) and homomorphically combine their local results under MHE (Collective Aggregation (CA) in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>). These local and global steps can be repeated (Iterate in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>), depending on the analytic task. At each new iteration, participating sites use the encrypted combination of the results of the previous iteration to compute on&nbsp;their local data without the need for decryption, e.g., gradient-descent steps in the training of a regression model. The collectively encrypted and aggregated final result is eventually switched (Collective Key Switching in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>) from encryption under the collective public key to encryption under the querier&rsquo;s public key (the blue lock in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>) such that only the querier can decrypt. The use of MHE ensures that the secret key of the underlying HE scheme never exists in full. Instead, the control over the decryption process is distributed across all participating sites, each one holding a fragment of the decryption key. This means that all participating sites have to agree to enable the decryption of any piece of data and that no single entity alone can decrypt the data.

Note that FAMHE avoids the use of centralized complex cryptographic operations that would require a more conservative parameterization and would result in higher computational and communication overheads (e.g., due to the use of larger ciphertexts). Therefore, FAMHE efficiently minimizes the computation and communication costs for a high-security level. We provide more details of our techniques in the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section.</p><p>We implemented FAMHE based on Lattigo<sup><a aria-label="Reference 32" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR32" title="Laboratory for Data Security, EPFL.

We chose the security parameters to always ensure high 128-bit-level security. We refer to the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section for a detailed configuration of FAMHE used in our experiments.</p><p>To demonstrate the performance of FAMHE, we developed efficient FA solutions based on FAMHE and our optimization techniques for two essential biomedical tasks: Kaplan&ndash;Meier survival analysis and GWAS. We present the results of these solutions on real datasets from two peer-reviewed studies that were originally conducted by centralizing the data from multiple institutions.</p><h3>Multicentric Kaplan&ndash;Meier survival analysis using FAMHE</h3><p>Kaplan&ndash;Meier survival analysis is a widely used method to assess patient&rsquo;s response (i.e., survival) over time to a specific treatment. For example, in a recent study, Samstein et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 29" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR29" title="Samstein, R. M. et al. Tumor mutational load predicts survival after immunotherapy across multiple cancer types. Nat. Genet. 51, 202&ndash;206 (2019)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">29</a></sup> demonstrated that the TMB is a predictor of clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments in patients with metastatic cancers. To obtain this conclusion, they computed Kaplan&ndash;Meier overall survival (OS) curves of 1662 advanced-cancer patients treated with ICI, and that are stratified by TMB values. OS was measured from the date of first ICI treatment to the time of death or the last follow-up. In Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>, we show the survival curves obtained from the original centralized study (Centralized, Nonsecure) and those obtained through our privacy-preserving federated workflow of FAMHE executed among three DPs. Note that for FAMHE, to illustrate the workflow of federated collaboration, we distributed the dataset across the DPs, each hosted on a different machine. FAMHE&rsquo;s analysis is then performed with each DP having access only to the locally held patient-level data, thus closely reflecting a real collaboration setting that involves independent healthcare centers. As a result, our federated solutions circumvent the privacy risks associated with data centralization in the original study. We observed that FAMHE produces survival curves identical to those of the original nonsecure approach. By using either approach, we are able to derive the key conclusion that the benefits of ICI increase with TMB.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 2: Secure and distributed reproduction of a survival-curve study.</b></figcaption><div><div><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y/figures/2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><picture><source srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp ,https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp " type="image/webp"></source><img alt="figure2" aria-describedby="Fig2" loading="lazy" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig2_HTML.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></picture></a></div><p><b>a</b> Survival curves generated in a centralized nonsecure manner and with FAMHE on the data used by Samstein et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 29" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR29" title="Samstein, R.

TMB stands for tumor mutational burden. With FAMHE, the original data are split among three data providers, and the querier obtains exact results.

The exact same numbers are obtained with the centralized, nonsecure solution and with FAMHE. <b>b</b> FAMHE execution time for the computation of one (or multiple) survival curve(s) with a maximum of 8192 time points. For both the aggregation and key switching (from the collective public key to the querier&rsquo;s key), most of the execution time is spent in communication (up to 98%), as the operations on the encrypted data are lightweight and parallelized on multiple levels, i.e., among the data providers and among the encrypted values.</p></div></figure></div><p>In Fig,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>b, we show that FAMHE produces exact results while maintaining computational efficiency, as the computation of the survival curves shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>a is executed in &lt;&thinsp;12&thinsp;s, even when the data are scattered among 96 DPs. We also observe that the execution time is almost independent of the DPs&rsquo; dataset size, as the same experiment performed on a 10&thinsp;&times; larger dataset (replicated 10&thinsp;&times;) takes almost exactly the same amount of time. We show that FAMHE&rsquo;s execution time remains below 12&thinsp;s for up to 8192 time points. We note that, in this particular study, the number of time points (instants at which an event can occur) is smaller than 200, due to the rounding off of survival times to months. In summary, the FAMHE-based Kaplan&ndash;Meier estimator produces precise results and scales efficiently with the number of time points, each DPs&rsquo; dataset size, and the number of DPs. We remark that the hazard ratio, which is often computed in survival-curve studies, can be directly estimated by the querier, based on the final result<sup><a aria-label="Reference 33" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR33" title="Tierney, J.

GWAS have led to numerous discoveries about human health and biology, and efforts to collect larger and more diverse cohorts to improve the power of GWAS. Their relevance to diverse human populations continues to grow. As we progress toward precision medicine and genetic sequencing becomes more broadly incorporated into routine patient care, large-scale GWAS that span multiple medical institutions will become increasingly more valuable. Here, we demonstrate the potential of FAMHE to enable multicentric GWAS that fully protects the privacy of patients&rsquo; data throughout the analysis.</p><p>We evaluated our approach on a GWAS dataset from McLaren et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 30" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR30" title="McLaren, P. J. et al. Polymorphisms of large effect explain the majority of the host genetic contribution to variation of HIV-1 virus load. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 112, 14658&ndash;14663 (2015)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30</a></sup>; they studied the host genetic determinants of HIV-1 viral load in an infected population of European individuals. It is known that the viral load observed in an asymptomatic patient after primary infection positively correlates with the rate of disease progression; this is the basis for the study of how host genetics modulates this phenotype. We obtained the available data for a subset of the cohort including 1857 individuals from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, with 4,057,178 genotyped variants. The dataset also included 12 covariates that represent ancestry components, which we also used in our experiments to correct for confounding effects. To test our federated-analysis approach, we distributed, in a manner analogous to the survival analysis experiments, the GWAS dataset across varying numbers of DPs.</p><p>Following the approach of McLaren et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 30" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR30" title="McLaren, P. J. et al. Polymorphisms of large effect explain the majority of the host genetic contribution to variation of HIV-1 virus load. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 112, 14658&ndash;14663 (2015)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30</a></sup>, we performed GWAS using linear regression of the HIV-1 viral load on each of the more than four million variants, always including the covariates. To enable this large-scale analysis in a secure and federated manner, we developed two complementary approaches based on our system: FAMHE-GWAS and FAMHE-FastGWAS. FAMHE-GWAS performs exact linear regression and incurs no loss of accuracy, whereas FAMHE-FastGWAS achieves faster runtime through iterative optimization at a small expense of accuracy. We believe that both modes are practical and that the choice between them would depend on the study setting. Importantly, both solutions do not reveal intermediate results at any point during the computation, and any data exchanged between the DPs to facilitate the computation are always kept hidden by collective encryption. We also emphasize that the DPs in both solutions utilize their local cleartext data and securely aggregate encrypted intermediate results, following the workflow presented in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>.</p><p>Both our solutions use a range of optimized computational routines that we developed in this work to carry out the sophisticated operations required in GWAS by using MHE. In FAMHE-GWAS, we exploit the fact that the same set of covariates are included in all regression models by computing once the inverse covariance matrix of the covariates, then for each variant computing an efficient update to the inverse matrix to reflect the contribution of each given variant. Our solution employs efficient MHE routines for each of these steps, including matrix inversion. In FAMHE-FastGWAS, we first subtract the covariate contributions from the phenotype by training once a linear model including only the covariates. We then train in parallel univariate models for all four million variants. We perform this step efficiently by using the stochastic gradient-descent algorithm implemented with MHE. Taken together, these techniques illustrate the computational flexibility of FAMHE and its potential to enable a wide range of analyses. Further details of our solutions are provided in the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section.</p><p>We compare FAMHE-GWAS and FAMHE-FastGWAS against (i) Original, the centralized nonsecure approach adopted by the original study, albeit on the Swiss HIV Cohort Study dataset, (ii) Meta-analysis<sup><a aria-label="Reference 35" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR35" title="PLINK Software.

Both our FAMHE-based methods produced highly accurate outputs that are nearly indistinguishable from the Original results. Consequently, our methods successfully implicated the same genomic regions with genome-wide significance found by Original, represented by the strongest associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7637813 on chromosome 3 (nominal <i>P</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;7.2&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;8</sup>) and rs112243036 on chromosome 6 (<i>P</i>&thinsp;=&thinsp;7.0&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;21</sup>). Notably, both these SNPs are in close vicinity to the two strongest signals reported by the original study<sup><a aria-label="Reference 30" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR30" title="McLaren, P.

Although the two previous SNPs were not available in our data subset to be analyzed, we reasonably posit that our findings capture the same association signals as in the original study, related through linkage disequilibrium.

We believe this observation highlights the limitation of meta-analyses when the sample sizes of individual datasets are limited. Similarly, the Independent approach obtained noisy results, which was further compounded by the issue of limited statistical power (for results obtained by every DP, see Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4</a>).

FAMHE-GWAS further reduces the error by roughly a factor of three to obtain even more accurate results. Whereas Meta-analysis and Independent approaches result in considerably larger errors.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Table 1 Absolute averaged error on the logarithm of the <i>P</i> values (&minus;log<sub>10</sub>(<i>P</i>)) and on the model weights (<i>w</i>) between Original, Independent and federated approaches.</b></figcaption></figure></div><p>FAMHE scales efficiently in all dimensions: number of DPs, samples, and variants (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4</a>). As displayed by Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4</a>a, FAMHE&rsquo;s runtime decreases when the workload is distributed among more DPs, and it is below 1&thinsp;h for a GWAS jointly performed by 12 DPs on more than 4 million variants with FAMHE-FastGWAS. It also shows that in a wide-area network, where the bandwidth is halved (from 1&thinsp;Gbps to 500&thinsp;Mbps) and the delay doubled (from 20 to 40&thinsp;ms), FAMHE execution time increases by a maximum of 26% over all experiments. FAMHE&rsquo;s execution time grows linearly with the number of patients (or samples) and variants (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4c, d</a>). In all experiments, the communication accounts for between 4 and 55% of FAMHE&rsquo;s total execution time. As described in the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section, FAMHE computes the <i>P</i> values of multiple (between 512 and 8192) variants in parallel, due to the SIMD property of the crypto scheme and is further parallelized among the DPs and by multithreading at each DP. FAMHE is therefore highly parallelizable, i.e., doubling the number of available threads would almost halve the execution time. Finally, FAMHE-GWAS, which performs exact linear regression, further reduces the error (by a factor of 3&thinsp;&times; compared to FAMHE-FastGWAS), but its execution times are generally higher than FAMHE-FastGWAS.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 4: FAMHE scaling.</b></figcaption><div><div><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y/figures/4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><picture><source srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp ,https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp " type="image/webp"></source><img alt="figure4" aria-describedby="Fig4" loading="lazy" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-25972-y/MediaObjects/41467_2021_25972_Fig4_HTML.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></picture></a></div><p><b>a</b> FAMHE&rsquo;s scaling with the number of data providers, <b>b</b> with the size of the dataset, and <b>c</b> with the number of variants considered in the GWAS.

To our knowledge, no other existing approaches achieve all of these properties: the FA approaches that share intermediate analysis results in cleartext among the DPs offer limited privacy protection or when used together with diffP techniques to mitigate leakage, they sacrifice accuracy. Meta-analysis approaches yield imprecise results compared to joint analysis, especially in settings where each DP has access to small cohorts, as we have shown. According to our estimates, centralized HE-based solutions have execution times that are 1&ndash;3 orders of magnitude greater than FAMHE due to the overhead of centralized computation, as well as compute-intensive cryptographic operations required by centralized HE (e.g., bootstrapping). Finally, SMC approaches, although an alternative for a small network of 2-4 DPs, have difficulty supporting a large number of DPs, due to their high communication overhead. Note that communication of SMC scales with the combined size of all datasets, whereas FAMHE shares only aggregate-level data, thus vastly reducing the communication burden.

Our efficient solutions for survival analysis and GWAS, based on our paradigm FAMHE, accurately reproduced published peer-reviewed studies while keeping the dataset distributed across multiple sites and ensuring that the shared intermediate data do not leak any private information. Alternative approaches based on meta-analysis or independent analysis of each dataset led to noisy results in our experiments, illustrating the benefits of our federated solutions. The fact that FAMHE led to practical federated algorithms for both the statistical calculations required by Kaplan&ndash;Meier curves and the large-scale regression tasks of GWAS reflects the ability of FAMHE to enable a wide range of other analyses in biomedical research, such as cohort exploration and the training and evaluation of disease risk prediction models.</p><p>Conceptually, FAMHE represents a novel approach to FA; it has not been previously explored for complex biomedical tasks. FAMHE combines the strengths of both conventional federated-learning approaches and cryptographic frameworks for secure computation. Like federated learning, FAMHE scales to large numbers of DPs and enables noninteractive local computation over each institution&rsquo;s dataset (available locally in cleartext), which approach minimizes the computational and communication burdens that cryptographic solutions<sup><a aria-label="Reference 17" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR17" title="Jagadeesh, K.

Our approach thus provides more rigorous privacy protection. In other words, in FAMHE, accuracy is traded off only with performance, similarly to nonsecure federated approaches, but differently from obfuscation-based solutions, FAMHE&rsquo;s security is absolute. We summarize our comparison of FAMHE with existing works in Supplementary Table&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>, Supplementary Notes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5</a>, and we refer to the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section for more details.</p><p>The fact that FAMHE shares only encrypted data among the DPs have important implications for its suitability to regulatory compliance and its potential to catalyze future efforts for multicentric biomedical studies. In recent work, it has been established by privacy law experts that data processed using MHE can be considered &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; data under the GDPR<sup><a aria-label="Reference 12" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR12" title="Scheibner, J. et al.

Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly simplify the requirements for contractual agreements and the obligations of data controllers with respect to regulations, such as GDPR, that often hinder multicentric medical studies. In contrast, existing FA solutions, where the intermediate results are openly shared, present more complicated paths toward compliance, as intermediate results could still be considered personal data<sup><a aria-label="Reference 6" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR6" title="Melis, L., Song, C., De Cristofaro, E. &amp; Shmatikov, V.

Furthermore, we will extend the capabilities of FAMHE by developing additional protocols for a broader range of standard analysis tools and ML algorithms in biomedical research (e.g., proportional-hazard regression models). A key step in this direction is to make our implementation of FAMHE&nbsp;easily configurable by practitioners for their own applications. Specifically, connecting FAMHE to existing user-friendly platforms such as MedCo<sup><a aria-label="Reference 38" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR38" title="Medco software.

Finally, we detail our experimental settings and explain how diffP can be ensured on the final result in FAMHE.</p><h3>System and Threat Model</h3><p>FAMHE supports a network of mutually distrustful medical institutions that act as DPs and hold subjects&rsquo; records. An authorized querier (see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>) can run queries, without threatening the data confidentiality and subjects&rsquo; privacy. The DPs and the querier are assumed to follow the protocol and to provide correct inputs. All-but-one DPs can be dishonest, i.e., they can try to infer information about other DPs by using the protocol&rsquo;s outputs. We assume that the DPs are available during the complete execution of a computation. However, to account for unresponsive DPs, FAMHE can use a threshold-encryption scheme, where the DPs secret-share<sup><a aria-label="Reference 39" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR39" title="Shamir, A.

                , 612&ndash;613 (1979)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">39</a></sup> their secret keys, thus enabling a subset of the DPs to perform the cryptographic interactive protocols.</p><p>FAMHE can be extended to withstand malicious behaviors. A malicious DP can try to disrupt the federated collaboration process, i.e., by performing wrong computations or inputting wrong results. This can be partially mitigated by requiring the DPs to publish transcripts of their computations and to produce zero-knowledge proofs of range<sup><a aria-label="Reference 40" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR40" title="Libert, B., Ling, S., Nguyen, K. &amp; Wang, H. Lattice-based zero-knowledge arguments for integer relations. In CRYPTO (2018)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40</a></sup>, thus constraining the DPs&rsquo; possible inputs. Also, the querier can try to infer information about a DP&rsquo;s local data from the final result. FAMHE can mitigate this inference attack by limiting the number of requests that a querier can perform and by adding noise to the final result (see &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;) to achieve diffP guarantees. Learning how to select the privacy parameters and to design a generic solution to apply these techniques for the wide range of applications enabled by FAMHE is part of future work.</p><h3>FAMHE&rsquo;s optimization techniques</h3><p>Here, we describe the main optimization techniques introduced in FAMHE. We then explain how these optimizations are used in FAMHE to compute survival curves and GWAS.</p><p>In order to parallelize and efficiently perform computationally intensive tasks, we rely on the SIMD property of the underlying cryptographic scheme and on edge computing, i.e., the computations are pushed to the DPs. In MHE, a ciphertext encrypts a vector of <i>N</i> values, and any operation (i.e., addition, multiplication, and rotation) performed on the ciphertext is executed on all the values simultaneously, i.e., SIMD. After a certain number of operations, the ciphertext needs to be refreshed, i.e., bootstrapped. A rotation is, in terms of computation complexity, one order of magnitude more expensive than an addition/multiplication, and a bootstrapping in a centralized setting is multiple orders of magnitudes (2&ndash;4) more expensive than any other operation. As the security parameters determine how many operations can be performed before a ciphertext needs to be bootstrapped, conservative parameters that incur large ciphertexts, but enable more operations without bootstrap are usually required in centralized settings. This results in higher communication and computation costs. With MHE, a ciphertext can be refreshed by a lightweight interactive protocol that, besides its efficiency, also alleviates the constraints on the cryptographic parameters and enables FAMHE to ensure a high level of security and still use smaller ciphertexts. For example, we show in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>b how FAMHE&rsquo;s execution time to compute a survival curve increases when doubling the size of a ciphertext (from 4096 to 8192 slots).</p><p>As discussed in the privacy-preserving pipeline for GWAS, in the case of GWAS, FAMHE efficiently performs multiple subsequent large-dimension matrix operations (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>) by optimizing the data packing (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3</a>) to perform several multiplications in parallel and to minimize the number of transformations required on the ciphertexts. FAMHE builds on the DPs&rsquo; ability to compute on their cleartext local data and combine them with encrypted data, thus reducing the overall computation complexity. GWAS also requires non-polynomial functions, e.g., the inverse of a matrix, to be evaluated on ciphertexts, which is not directly applicable in HE. In FAMHE, these non-polynomial functions are efficiently approximated by relying on Chebyshev polynomials. We chose to rely on Chebyshev polynomials instead of on least-square polynomial approximations in order to minimize the maximum approximation error hence avoid that the function diverges on specific inputs. This technique has been shown to accurately approximate non-polynomial functions in the training of generalized models<sup><a aria-label="Reference 24" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR24" title="Froelicher, D. et al.

In GWAS, for example, we rely on the Gauss&ndash;Jordan (GJ) method<sup><a aria-label="Reference 42" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR42" title="Atkinson, K. E.

We chose this algorithm as it can be efficiently executed by relying on the aforementioned features: row operations can be efficiently parallelized with SIMD and divisions are replaced by polynomial approximations.</p><h3>Privacy-preserving pipeline for survival curves</h3><p>Survival curves are generally estimated with the Kaplan&ndash;Meier estimator<sup><a aria-label="Reference 43" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR43" title="Goel, M.

We show in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>a the exact replica of the survival curve presented by Samstein et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 29" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR29" title="Samstein, R.

In a survival curve, each step down is the occurrence of an event. The ticks indicate the presence of censored patients, i.e., patients who withdrew from the study. The number of censored patients at time <i>t</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> is indicated by <i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>. As shown in Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>, to compute this curve, each DP <i>i</i> locally computes, encodes, and encrypts a vector of the form <span>\({n}_{0}^{(i)},{c}_{0}^{(i)},{d}_{0}^{(i)},...,{n}_{T}^{(i)},{c}_{T}^{(i)},{d}_{T}^{(i)}\)</span> containing the values <span>\({n}_{j}^{(i)},{c}_{j}^{(i)},{d}_{j}^{(i)}\)</span> corresponding to each time point <i>t</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> for <i>t</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>&thinsp;=&thinsp;0,&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;,&thinsp;<i>T</i>. All the DPs&rsquo; vectors are then collectively aggregated. The encryption of the final result is then collectively switched from the collective public key to the querier&rsquo;s public key that can decrypt the result with its secret key and generate the curve following Eq. (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#Equ1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>).</p><h3>Privacy-preserving pipeline for GWAS</h3><p>We briefly describe the genome-wide association-study workflow before explaining how we perform it in a federated and privacy-preserving manner. We conclude by detailing how we obtained our baseline GWAS results in &ldquo;Results&rdquo; with the PLINK software.</p><p>We consider a dataset of <i>p</i> samples, i.e., patients. Each patient is described by <i>f</i> features or covariates (with indexes 1 to <i>f</i>). We list all recurrent symbols and acronyms in Supplementary Table&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3</a>. Hence, we have a covariates matrix <span>\({{{{{{{\bf{X}}}}}}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{(p\times f)}\)</span>. Each patient also has a phenotype or label, i.e., <span>\({{{{{{{\bf{y}}}}}}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{(p\times 1)}\)</span> and <i>v</i> variant values, i.e., one for each variant considered in the association test. The <i>v</i> variant values for all <i>p</i> patients form another matrix <span>\({{{{{{{\bf{V}}}}}}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{(p\times v)}\)</span>. To perform the GWAS, for each variant <i>i</i>, the matrix <span>\({{{{{{{\bf{X}}}}}}}}^{\prime} =[{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{1}}}}}}}},{{{{{{{\bf{X}}}}}}}},{{{{{{{\bf{V}}}}}}}}[:,i]]\)</span><span>\(\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{(p\times (f+2))}\)</span>, i.e., the matrix <b>X</b> is augmented by a column of 1s (intercept) and the column of one variant <i>i</i>, is constructed.

Each DP<sub><i>i</i></sub> has a subset of <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> patients.

We remark that, as any exchanged information is collectively encrypted, this does not have any security implications. In a CA, each DP encrypts (E()) its local result with the collective key, aggregates its children DPs encrypted results with its encrypted local results, and sends the sum to its parent DP such that DP<sub><i>R</i></sub> obtains the encrypted result aggregated among all DPs. We recall here that with the homomorphic-encryption scheme used, vectors of values can be encrypted in one ciphertext and that any operation performed on a ciphertext is simultaneously performed on all vector elements, i.e., SIMD. We rely on this property to parallelize the operations at multiple levels: among the DPs, among the threads in each DP and among the values in the ciphertexts.</p><p>We rely on the GJ method<sup><a aria-label="Reference 42" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR42" title="Atkinson, K. E. An Introduction to Numerical Analysis (Wiley, 2008)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">42</a></sup> to compute the inverse of the encrypted covariance matrix. We chose this algorithm as it requires only row operations, which can be efficiently performed with SIMD. The only operation that is not directly applicable in HE is the division that we approximated with a Chebyshev polynomial. Note that we avoid any other division in the protocol by pushing them to the last step that is executed by the querier <i>Q</i> after decryption. In Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>, we keep 1/<i>c</i> until decryption.</p><p>In Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>, we describe how we further reduce the computation overhead by obtaining the covariates&rsquo; weights <span>\({{{{{{{\bf{w}}}}}}}}^{\prime}\)</span> with a lightweight federated gradient descent (FGD), by reporting the obtained covariates&rsquo; contributions in the phenotype <i>y</i>, which becomes <i>y</i>&Prime;. To compute the <i>P</i> value, we then compute only one element of the covariance inverse matrix <span>\({({{{{{{{{\bf{X}}}}}}}}}^{^{\prime} T}{{{{{{{\bf{X}}}}}}}}^{\prime} )}^{(-1)}[f+2;f+2]\)</span>, instead of the entire inverse. To perform the FGD, we follow the method described by Froelicher et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 24" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR24" title="Froelicher, D. et al. Scalable privacy-preserving distributed learning. In Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, 323&ndash;347 (2021)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">24</a></sup>, without disclosing any intermediate values.</p><p>We describe in Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3</a> how the (main) values used in both protocols are packed to optimize the communication and the number of required operations (multiplications, rotations). We perform permutations, duplications, and rotations on cleartext data that are held by the DPs (indicated in orange in Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3</a>); and we avoid, as much as possible, the operations on encrypted vectors. Note that rotations on ciphertexts are almost one order of magnitude slower than multiplications or additions and should be avoided when possible. As ciphertexts have to be aggregated among DPs, a tradeoff has to be found between computation cost (e.g., rotations) and data packing, as a smaller packing density would require the exchange of more ciphertexts.</p><p>In both protocols, all operations for <i>v</i> variants are executed in parallel, due to the ciphertext packing (SIMD). For a 128-bit security level, the computations are performed simultaneously for 512 variants with FAMHE-GWAS and for 8192 with FAMHE-FastGWAS. These operations are further parallelized due to multithreading and to the distribution of the workload among the DPs. We highlight (in bold) the main steps and aggregated values in the protocol and note that DPs&rsquo; local data are in cleartext, whereas all exchanged data are collectively encrypted (E()).</p><h3>
                  <b>Baseline computations with PLINK</b>
                </h3><p>As explained in the &ldquo;Results&rdquo; section, we relied on the PLINK software to obtain our baseline results for the (i) Original approach in which GWAS is computed on the entire centralized dataset, (ii) the Independent approach in which each DP performs the GWAS on its own subset of the data, and (iii) for the Meta-analysis in which the DPs perform the GWAS on their local data before combining their results. For (i) and (ii), we relied on PLINK 2.0 and its linear regression (&ndash;<span>glm</span> option)-based association test. For (iii), we relied on PLINK 1.9 and used the weighted-<i>Z</i> test approach to perform the meta-analysis.</p><h3>Experimental settings</h3><p>We implemented our solutions by building on top of Lattigo<sup><a aria-label="Reference 32" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR32" title="Laboratory for Data Security, EPFL.

More formally, (<i>&#1013;</i>, <i>&delta;</i>)-diffP<sup><a aria-label="Reference 47" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR47" title="Dwork, C., McSherry, F., Nissim, K. &amp; Smith, A.

We also note that our solution would then enable the obfuscation of only the final result, i.e., the noise can be added before the final decryption, and all the previous steps can be executed with exact values as no intermediate value is decrypted. This is a notable improvement with respect to existing federated-learning solutions, based on diffP<sup><a aria-label="Reference 37" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR37" title="Kim, M., Lee, J., Ohno-Machado, L. &amp; Jiang, X.

In the solution by Kim et al.<sup><a aria-label="Reference 37" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#ref-CR37" title="Kim, M., Lee, J., Ohno-Machado, L. &amp; Jiang, X.

This is achieved by having each DP generate and add a partial noise such that, when aggregated, the total noise follows the Laplace distribution. The noise magnitude is determined by the sensitivity of the computed function and this sensitivity is similar for each DP output and for the aggregated final result. This means that, as the intermediate values remain encrypted in FAMHE, a noise with the same magnitude can be added only once on the final result, thus ensuring the same level of privacy with a lower distortion of the result.</p><h3>Reporting summary</h3><p>Further information on research design is available in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25972-y#MOESM2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nature Research Reporting Summary</a> linked to this article.</p></div></div></section>

                    <p><strong>Saudi human rights activist and author Manal al-Sharif</strong> says Australians are complacent about the rapid growth in digital surveillance and the impact of tech and media monopolies on freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Speaking on an Electronic Frontiers Australia webinar, Ms al-Sharif discussed the dangers of &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo; and the weaponisation of social media, along with the growing electronic surveillance powers in Australia.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23005"><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal.jpg" srcset="https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal.jpg 800w,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal-320x240.jpg 320w,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal-768x576.jpg 768w,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal.jpg 800w,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal-320x240.jpg 320w,https://www.innovationaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thumbnail_Manal-768x576.jpg 768w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>Saudi human rights activist Manal al-Sharif.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ms al-Sharif is a Saudi human rights campaigner and author, and is now the manager of cybersecurity strategy at UNSW.</p>
<p>She said Australians need to be more aware of the influence of tech and media monopolies on their activities online and their freedom of speech and expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first came to Australia, I thought people were too complacent. Australian media is controlled by a few monopolies which creates this sense of fear, complacency and self-censorship,&rdquo; Ms al-Sharif said on the panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living in a democracy is scary when tech manipulation becomes a form of soft oppression. People don&rsquo;t realise they are being manipulated and that they are victims of persuasive technology. We think we have reached a conclusion from our own freedom of thinking. This is completely misleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you go online and are facing a machine that understands who you are, what makes you tick and how to keep you engaged &ndash; there is no freedom of choice and freedom of thinking anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms al-Sharif deleted all of her social media accounts after seeing how authoritarian regimes can manipulate these platforms, and said the power of big tech firms shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social media was once used to give people a voice in authoritarian regimes. That was taken away as soon as these authoritative regimes understood how to use social media in unfair ways,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These companies have deep pockets to hire the best data scientists in the world. They use machine learning to understand and predict our behaviours. That&rsquo;s what makes it so scary. It is not the information that is of such concern but rather the creation and weaponisation of these intimate profiles. We are living in an age of continuous surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The growing surveillance powers in Australia have been in the spotlight recently following the passage of the Identify and Disrupt bill last month. This handed &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; new powers to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, allowing them to access three new warrants to access the computers and networks of those suspected of conducting criminal activity, &ldquo;disrupt&rdquo; their data and take over their accounts covertly.</p>
<p>The powers have been slammed by a range of civil and digital rights and legal organisations as being &ldquo;extraordinarily dangerous&rdquo; and marking the next step in the &ldquo;explosion of the surveillance state&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Electronic Frontiers Australia policy team chair Angus Murray, who also spoke on the webinar, said the Identify and Disrupt powers need to be viewed as part of the wider picture of powers introduced in the last two decades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was a lone Act, it may not be as scary. But when you consider it alongside the full suite of power we&rsquo;ve afforded law enforcement, the reality becomes more alarming,&rdquo; Mr Murray said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Identify and Disrupt bill is only one in a series of developments that were largely a reaction to the events of 9/11. However, a rapid expansion has occurred over the last five years. Since the metadata retention scheme came into force in 2015, we&rsquo;ve seen much more intrusive powers arise, notably the Assistance and Access Act. The Identify and Disrupt bill is only the latest development in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legislation serves to &ldquo;legitimise what is being done by the government&rdquo;, Mr Murray said, and may serve to damage trust in technology in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Society is enhanced by dissenting views and the ability to have a robust discussion, even if the topic is unpalatable. My concern for the future is that we are seeing a situation where people are becoming less trustworthy of technology,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology, because of these legislative powers, is then becoming less trusting of the consumers. This leads to a breakdown of trust on both sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government is opening the gate and tiptoeing along the edge of the line [to totalitarianism] that could very easily pass. If you don&rsquo;t care about the impact now, you should care about how it could impact your children, or your friends&rsquo; children and the future of Australian democracy.&rdquo;</p>

Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The project was meant to be completed and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/enbridge-says-line-3-replacement-133714935.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start functioning</a> on Friday.</p><p>Police have arrested more than 900 demonstrators opposing Line 3 and its impact on climate and Indigenous rights, according to the Pipeline Legal Action Network.</p><p>It&rsquo;s common for protesters opposing pipeline construction to face private security hired by companies, as they did during demonstrations against the Dakota Access pipeline. But in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Minnesota</a>, a financial agreement with a foreign company has given public police forces an incentive to arrest demonstrators.</p><p>The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which regulates pipelines, decided rural police should not have to pay for increased strain from Line 3 protests. As a condition of granting Line 3 permits, the commission required Enbridge to set up an escrow account to reimburse police for responding to demonstrations.</p><p>Enbridge told the Guardian an independent account manager allocates the funds, and police decide when protesters are breaking the law. But records obtained by the Guardian show the company meets daily with police to discuss intelligence gathering and patrols. And when Enbridge wants protesters removed, it calls police or <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanizingStory/status/1404295038235025415" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sends letters</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Our police are beholden to a foreign company,&rdquo; Tara Houska, founder of the Indigenous frontline group Giniw Collective, told the Guardian. &ldquo;They are working hand in hand with big oil. They are actively working for a company. Their duty is owed to the state of Minnesota and to the tribal citizens of Minnesota.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very clear violation of the public&rsquo;s trust,&rdquo; she added.</p><h2>Overtime pay for<strong> </strong>shooting rubber bullets and Mace</h2><p>In July, Enbridge began drilling under the Red Lake River near Thief River Falls. A police report said 20 to 100 demonstrators had gathered next to the site for days. The Pennington county sheriff&rsquo;s office sent a request for help and several police agencies sent officers to protect the fenced-in drill site.</p><p>Brandon Thyen, Chisago county sheriff, requested Enbridge reimbursement when his deputies were assigned &ldquo;to protect the construction workers and equipment from activists and protesters&rdquo;.</p><p>On 29 July, Houska said Line 3 opponents, who identify as water protectors, attempted to stop the drilling, under skies that were thick with wildfire smoke from the west. &ldquo;We were met with rubber bullets and Mace by a big line of police officers from multiple counties shooting at us at point blank range,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>At about 5pm a group of protesters ran from a nearby camp to the drill site, leaned ladders against the fence and began to climb over, according to a Wright county police report obtained by the Guardian. Police told them they were under arrest but they kept climbing. Then police fired at protesters with &ldquo;less-lethal munitions&rdquo; &ndash; weapons that are more likely to injure than kill someone. Wright county officers fired pepper spray at protesters and arrested four people.</p><p>Police shot Houska with rubber bullets that left bruises and welts on her skin, <a href="https://twitter.com/zhaabowekwe/status/1430366704660516872" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photos show</a>. It&rsquo;s not clear which police agency fired the rubber bullets &ndash; Wright county said it wasn&rsquo;t them.</p><p>Enbridge reimbursed the Wright county sheriff&rsquo;s office $26,886.44 for mileage, meals, wages and benefits for officers who worked at the drill site from 28 July to 1 August 2021. The Enbridge fund also reimbursed Anoka, Chisago, Marshall and Clay counties for sending officers to the drill site.</p><p>Houska said she overheard officers saying they would get overtime pay for responding on 29 June. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re excited about the piggy bank Enbridge has created for them,&rdquo; she said.</p><h2>Enbridge picked up tab for surveillance and cheeseburgers</h2><p>On 12 March 2021, Grand Rapids police followed several vehicles in Aitkin county that they suspected contained Line 3 protesters. Investigator Brian Mattson followed a Jeep into a mall parking lot. The occupants, a &ldquo;white female and Hispanic or native american male&rdquo;, recorded him and questioned why he was following them. Sergeant Andrew Morgan wrote in his report that he &ldquo;maintained surveillance on multiple believed rally participants&rdquo;, including monitoring a vehicle that contained a &ldquo;sleeping dragon&rdquo; device that protesters use to lock themselves to equipment.</p><p>Enbridge reimbursed Grand Rapids $4,048.43 for the wages of nine officers who were patrolling Aitkin county that day.</p><p>From 4 to 9 June, in response to a mutual aid request, the McLeod county sheriff&rsquo;s office sent police to Wadena and Aitkin counties for what they called &ldquo;operation safety net&rdquo;. They billed their mileage, wages and meals to the Enbridge account, a total of $15,787.57.</p><p>The evening of 8 June, the McLeod county officers dined together at the Fireside Inn in Aitkin county. Detective Andrew DeMeyer had buffalo chips and a fiesta salad for $19.15, Deputy Jonathan Robbin had a chicken strip basket, fries and mozzarella sticks for $21.35, Deputy Joshua Fahey had a half chicken with fries for $14.95, and Sgt Billy Kroll enjoyed a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and two non-alcoholic beers for $22.45. They billed their meals to the Enbridge account.</p><p>On 7 June hundreds of protesters occupied an Enbridge pump station in Hubbard county, north of Park Rapids, blockading the site and locking themselves to equipment. The Hubbard county sheriff&rsquo;s office sent a &ldquo;code red&rdquo; to the Beltrami county field force extrication team, which had received training from 2016 to 2020 to remove protesters who used sleeping dragons.</p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=21ea6ecfedd6893d9b896be8e95be1b7 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=4aa4ae2c406ac3063a3539ea50a60c09 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6b39389b4a0aa500f76b2f9e9b0903f2 890w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=21ea6ecfedd6893d9b896be8e95be1b7 1240w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=4aa4ae2c406ac3063a3539ea50a60c09 1210w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6b39389b4a0aa500f76b2f9e9b0903f2 890w"></source><source sizes="(min-width: 660px) 620px, 100vw" srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9d0893bb913941958d96eae381c1d5f1 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bef6df1ecc22e7735166ec9e206196d2 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=28086f467ab14f45073637790ab5e7c0 445w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9d0893bb913941958d96eae381c1d5f1 620w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=bef6df1ecc22e7735166ec9e206196d2 605w,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=28086f467ab14f45073637790ab5e7c0 445w"></source><img alt="Indigenous protesters and allies occupied an Enbridge site on 7 June, some chaining themselves to equipment." loading="lazy" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901f5219420c727c74da61de3a37790264a2baf8/0_168_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=6b39389b4a0aa500f76b2f9e9b0903f2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></picture></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Indigenous protesters and allies occupied an Enbridge site on 7 June, some chaining themselves to equipment.</span> Photograph: Alex Kormann/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Enbridge reimbursed the Beltrami county sheriff&rsquo;s office more than $180,000 for the training and equipment its officers would use that day. This included $17,510.99 for equipment, including ballistic helmets, and another $4,095 for shields.</p><p>Beltrami officers put on their riot helmets, grabbed their shields and boarded a school bus, according to police reports. At the site, they arrested protesters, including elderly people, and people who locked themselves to bulldozers and excavators.</p><p>Enbridge reimbursed Beltrami county sheriff&rsquo;s office $17,572.22 for police wages and overtime pay for their work that day.</p><p>Beltrami also requested reimbursement for pepper spray and batons, but the manager of the escrow account wrote in an email that these were not personal protective equipment and could not be reimbursed.</p><p>Simone Senogles, member of the Red Lake Nation and leadership team member for the Indigenous Environmental Network, participated in actions on 7 June to protect the Mississippi River and drinking water.</p><p>&ldquo;You wish they were actually there to protect and serve us, and not to protect and serve a pipeline and a company,&rdquo; she said of police. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the antithesis of democracy in my mind.&rdquo;</p><h2>Oil company &lsquo;calling the shots in Minnesota&rsquo;</h2><p>Records obtained by the Guardian show a close working relationship between Enbridge and police.</p><p>In December 2020, Cass county&rsquo;s sheriff&rsquo;s office began &ldquo;proactive safety patrols&rdquo; of communities along the pipeline route. Up to 6 August the Enbridge account reimbursed the sheriff $849,163.40 for these patrols.</p><p>Tom Burch, Cass county sheriff, wrote in his request for reimbursement that a Cass county supervisor was assigned to the project and met several times daily with Enbridge public safety liaison staff to discuss safety concerns, intelligence gathering and public safety initiatives for the day.</p><p>Burch told the Guardian he would have initiated these patrols even if they couldn&rsquo;t be reimbursed from Enbridge. &ldquo;Cass County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office does not work for Enbridge,&rdquo; he wrote in an email. &ldquo;Cass County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office responds appropriately to the public safety needs for the citizens of Cass County and our communities.&rdquo;</p><p>On 9 January 2021, Kevin Ott, a Grand Rapids police department officer, wrote in a report: &ldquo;I was contacted by employees of Enbridge who advised me that there were multiple protesters that had occupied their job site to the east of US Hwy #169,&rdquo; in Aitkin county. He arrested one man who refused to leave the site. Enbridge later reimbursed the Grand Rapids police epartment $1,306.35.</p><p>Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, an Indigenous environmental group, told the Guardian she was at the 9 January protest and witnessed an Enbridge employee directing police. &ldquo;Enbridge has been calling the police shots in northern Minnesota,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Asked if the company is directing police, an Enbridge spokesperson, Michael Barnes, wrote in an email: &ldquo;Officers decide when protesters are breaking the law &ndash; or putting themselves and others in danger.&rdquo;</p><p>The Guardian requested comment from Beltrami county sheriff&rsquo;s office, Grand Rapids police department and McLeod county sheriff&rsquo;s office, but did not receive responses by deadline.</p><p>Citing concerns that similar funding models could be replicated in other states, lawyers are close to filing a lawsuit challenging the legality of the escrow fund. &ldquo;It presents a dystopian future, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re challenging it,&rdquo; said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a lawyer with the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund.</p><p>In August, Houska and other water protectors <a href="https://www.wecaninternational.org/PressReleases/Line-3-Indigenous-Water-Protectors-Meet-with-U.N.-Special-Rapporteur-on-Human-Rights-Defenders-over-Human-Rights-Violation-Concerns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">met with</a> the UN special rapporteur on human rights to share their concerns about police and the escrow fund. Houska said the financial relationship had resulted in the criminalization of protest and was setting a precedent that &ldquo;should scare anyone&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;As we see the climate crisis raging all around us, and the world is on fire, and the water protectors are in jail, at what point do we step in to prevent a precedent like this being the norm?&rdquo; Houska asked.</p></div></div>]]></content>

In response, the judge created a 100-metre exclusion zone around her property and a 1,000ft no-fly zone above it to protect her from the sheikh and his agents.</p><p>In his phone-hacking judgment, McFarlane criticised Sheikh Mohammed in the strongest terms.</p><p>&ldquo;The findings represent a total abuse of trust, and indeed an abuse of power, to a significant extent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish to make it plain that I regard the findings that I have now made to be of the utmost seriousness in the context of the children&rsquo;s welfare. They may well have a profound impact upon the ability of the mother and of the court to trust him with any but the most minimal and secure arrangements for contact with his children in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>On one occasion, according to the judgment, when Haya&rsquo;s phone was hacked, 265 megabytes of data was uploaded, equivalent to about 24 hours of digital voice recording data or 500 photographs. It occurred during a period described by McFarlane as &ldquo;a particularly busy and financially interesting time in these proceedings, with the buildup to key hearings relating to the mother&rsquo;s long-term financial claims for herself and the children&rdquo;.</p><p>In a witness statement, the sheikh, who has not appeared in court throughout the proceedings &ndash; unlike his ex-wife who was a regular attendee &ndash; argued that &ldquo;it is hard to see how the hacking allegations make a substantial difference&rdquo; to his contact with his children, but this was dismissed out of hand by McFarlane.</p><figure><div><picture itemprop="contentUrl"><source media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-resolution: 120dpi)" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px"

increase scrutiny on Britain&rsquo;s relationship with the UAE, coming after a December 2019 ruling by McFarlane that found the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/dubai-ruler-sheikh-mohammed-organised-kidnapping-of-his-children-uk-court-finds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sheikh orchestrated the abductions</a> of two of his other children, Princess Latifa and Princess Shamsa &ndash; in the latter case from the streets of Cambridge &ndash; and subjected Haya to a campaign of &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo;.</p><p>McFarlane used the opportunity of the phone-hacking ruling to criticise the sheikh&rsquo;s claim after the December 2019 judgment in which the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/dubai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dubai</a> ruler said: &ldquo;As head of government I was not able to participate in the court&rsquo;s fact-finding process.&rdquo; McFarlane stated this was untrue as the sheikh had submitted two witness statements to that trial and had had a large legal team that he had instructed to withdraw from the courtroom rather than participate.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed&rsquo;s expensively assembled legal team had attempted to prevent McFarlane ruling on the phone hacking by claiming that the court had no jurisdiction to sit in judgment on a foreign act of state, namely the alleged use of spyware by the UAE and/or Dubai. However, in separate hearings this was rejected by the high court and court of appeal, with the supreme court refusing to allow a further appeal.</p><p>Haya <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/dubai-princesss-flight-london-diplomatic-crisis-princess-haya-sheikh-mohammed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fled to London in April 2019</a> with the couple&rsquo;s two young children, triggering a still ongoing legal battle over custody, access and financial support.</p><p>In a witness statement supporting her application for the exclusion zone around her Castlewood House home, previously occupied by Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Haya said: &ldquo;It feels as if I am being stalked, that there is literally nowhere for me to go to be safe from [her ex-husband], or those acting in his interests. It is hugely oppressive &hellip; I feel like I cannot breathe any more; it feels like being suffocated. I don&rsquo;t want the children to live with the kind of fear that punctuates my existence at all times. They do not deserve this.&rdquo;</p><p>On 9 December last year, granting her request, McFarlane said that in the abduction of his two adult daughters, the sheikh had demonstrated &ldquo;his ability to act and to do so irrespective of domestic criminal law&rdquo;, explicitly referencing the fact that Shamsa was taken from Cambridge to Dubai by helicopter. &ldquo;The mother is justified in regarding the purchase of a substantial estate immediately abutting her own as being a very significant threat to her security, both in terms of providing an opportunity for 24-hour close surveillance and as a close-to-hand transport hub for a helicopter,&rdquo; the judge said.</p><p>After the findings were published, Sheikh Mohammed issued a statement in which he continued to deny the allegations relating to hacking.</p><p>&ldquo;These matters concern supposed operations of state security. As a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters... Neither the Emirate of Dubai nor the UAE are party to these proceedings and they did not participate in the hearing. The findings are therefore inevitably based on an incomplete picture.&rdquo;</p></div></div>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28668789" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div><div><div><p><span>In 2018, Oakland</span> enacted an innovative law giving citizens a voice in police use of surveillance technology. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called it &ldquo;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/oakland-new-gold-standard-community-control-police-surveillance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the new gold standard in community control of police surveillance</a>.&rdquo; Since then, about 20 other cities have adopted similar laws.</p><p>Now, Brian Hofer, one of the architects of Oakland&rsquo;s law, says it&rsquo;s not working. Earlier this month, Hofer <a href="https://secure-justice.org/blog/why-should-you-care-about-our-lawsuit-against-the-city-of-oakland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed suit against</a> the city and the police department, saying they had repeatedly violated the law.</p><p>&ldquo;We ignored human nature,&rdquo; Hofer says in an interview. &ldquo;Police don't like to be transparent. Surveillance technology use is by design secretive, and no self-interested party is going to voluntarily highlight anything negative about their own proposal.&rdquo; A spokesperson for the Oakland Police Department says it doesn&rsquo;t comment on ongoing legal matters.</p><p>Even in Oakland, however, the law has given critics of police surveillance a platform. Indeed, Hofer sued under a provision of the law that allows citizens to take the city to court. He hopes it leads to the appointment of an independent counsel to review the police department&rsquo;s data and assessment of surveillance tech.</p><p>&ldquo;Like any law, [the surveillance ordinance] needs to be enforced,&rdquo; says Matt Cagle, a staff attorney for the Technology and Civil Liberties Program at the ACLU of Northern California. &ldquo;Which is why it's so great to see people in Oakland and San Francisco use it to take the police to court.&rdquo;</p><p>A national review of the laws&mdash;dubbed CCOPS, for Community Control of Police Surveillance&mdash;suggests other small successes. In Nashville, opposition from a community group created by such a law stopped&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;a proposal for the city to buy automated license plate readers.</p><p>The laws vary in their specifics. Some require regular meetings between police and community members, annual audits for effectiveness and potential bias, greater transparency of vendors and the cost to taxpayers of any new tech, and a period of public comment before purchasing new tech such as body cameras or ShotSpotter, which uses microphones to detect gunfire.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Local-Surveillance-Ordinances-White-Paper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">student white paper</a> released earlier this year, the Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic at the Berkeley School of Law said many of the ordinances are weaker than Oakland&rsquo;s. New York City and Grand Rapids don&rsquo;t empower citizens to file suit, as Oakland does. In six jurisdictions, including Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto, California, police are exempt from the rules. So while a library or school would have to allow for public comment for new surveillance tools, police are exempt from restrictions if they&rsquo;re executing a warrant or responding to a crisis.</p><p>Most of the cities give police broad latitude to use surveillance tech during &ldquo;exigent circumstances.&rdquo; Students Tyler Takemoto and Ari Chivukula, authors of the white paper, say this can create loopholes in citizen oversight.</p><p>&ldquo;We know that different local governments considered, for example, racial justice uprisings last summer to fall within that category of extenuating exigent circumstances,&rdquo; Takemoto says.</p><p>Acknowledging that there&rsquo;s no perfect combination of rules, the authors suggest such ordinances empower citizens to sue and create independent bodies to oversee police and provide support. &ldquo;Maybe the most important thing is the outside advice &hellip; a local nonprofit or community group that's going to stay engaged,&rdquo; Chivukula says. &ldquo;If you don't have public engagement, then there's no pressure.&rdquo;</p><p>The movement in Oakland toward reining in police surveillance began in 2014, when groups including the ACLU and EFF protested a proposed &ldquo;Domain Awareness Center,&rdquo; a fusion center combining microphones, CCTV, and surveillance data.</p><p>First created for port security, the city was moving toward approving a citywide expansion. The advocacy groups successfully campaigned to cancel the expansion and create a temporary privacy committee that would write policies for the city&rsquo;s use of technology. This became an early iteration of the CCOPS model.</p></div></div><div><div><p>&ldquo;With an ongoing reporting obligation, we would for the first time ever have real data to determine efficacy, inform policy decisions like retention limits and third-party access, and identify any civil liberties impact,&rdquo; Hofer says. At the time, he says, &ldquo;we did naively believe that law enforcement would be truthful in the presentation of data and when discussing the pros and cons of potential uses.&rdquo;</p><p>In the suit, however, Hofer alleges Oakland police have refused to provide the necessary use policies for technologies that were in place before the ordinance took effect, and have allowed federal officials to access surveillance data without written requests, among other things. According to the suit, the police agreed to audit the use of license plate readers for bias and effectiveness, but haven't produced any audits since 2018.</p><p>In 2017, Nashville formed a Community Oversight Board that pushed for a referendum where residents voted in favor of adopting a local version of CCOPS. Then, last year, city councilmember Courtney Johnston introduced a bill enabling police to purchase and install license plate readers, citing a nationwide crime spike and an ongoing street racing problem.</p><p>Andr&eacute;s Mart&iacute;nez, the chair of the oversight board, helped rally opposition, citing reports questioning the effectiveness of the technology. The proposal has been deferred several times.</p><p>&ldquo;In reality, when you look at what license plate readers actually do, it's minimal compared to the amount of data that they capture,&rdquo; Martinez says. &ldquo;I think that our money and attention would be better served in trying to find actual community-based solutions to our public safety issues.&rdquo;</p><p>Martinez says the oversight board has built relationships with other city agencies, like the Department of Emergency Communications, and forged a memorandum of understanding that gives board members a larger role in misconduct investigations. Simply creating the oversight board has led to more inroads and, he says, a better relationship between police and board members.</p><p>Johnston, the councilmember, says she&rsquo;s voluntarily held the bill because she wants to add restrictions on use of the license plate readers that will make both the oversight board and opposing councilmembers more comfortable with the technology. She has already amended the proposal to restrict where and when the cameras can be installed, how many officers would have access to them, and how long police retain the data. In the meantime, she notes, crime rates have increased and several neighborhoods have complained of disappointingly slow police responses.</p><p>&ldquo;I have the votes,&rdquo; she explains. Johnston says she plans to reintroduce the bill later this year and push for its passage, opening the door for police to eventually adopt the tech. &ldquo;We've had multiple community engagement opportunities, special committee meetings, and multiple amendments,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;So we're at a point now where we're just going to have to agree to disagree.&rdquo;</p><p>Nathan Sheard, organizing director of the EFF, explains that at its best, CCOPS is useful in getting people to realize that &ldquo;the trade-off between civil liberties and public safety is a false dichotomy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust between the community and the people who are sworn to protect them is what actually provides public safety,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You need engagement of the community in order to actually have public safety.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>More Great WIRED Stories</p><ul><li>&#128233; The latest on tech, science, and more: <a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get our newsletters</a>!</li><li>Can robots evolve into <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/can-robots-evolve-into-machines-of-loving-grace/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">machines of loving grace?</a></li><li>3D printing helps <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/3d-printing-helps-ultracold-quantum-experiments-go-small/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ultracold quantum experiments</a> go small</li><li>How community <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-prep-act-pharmacies/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pharmacies stepped up during Covid</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-artful-escape-is-psychedelic-perfection/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Artful Escape</em></a> is psychedelic perfection</li><li>How to send <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-send-messages-that-automatically-disappear/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">messages that automatically disappear</a></li><li>&#128065;&#65039; Explore AI like never before with <a href="https://www.wired.com/category/artificial-intelligence/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our new database</a></li><li>&#127918; WIRED Games: Get the latest <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/video-games/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories&amp;itm_content=footer-recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tips, reviews, and more</a></li><li>&#128241; Torn between the latest phones?

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28656580" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comments</a><hr><div><section><div><p>At first, Ryan Lackey thought the email was a scam. It arrived one morning in March, bearing news that Facebook had received an order from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to turn over data from personal<b> </b>accounts Lackey uses to chat with friends and exchange cat photos.</p></div><div><p>Even weirder, the email said Facebook had been forced to keep this intrusion secret. Six months later, Lackey, a computer security consultant in Puerto Rico, still has no idea what Facebook turned over to an FBI investigation that he believes may have started as early as 2019.</p></div></section></div><div><section><div><p>&ldquo;My online life, at least half of it touches Facebook in some way,&rdquo; said Lackey, 42.</p></div><div><p>Every year, Facebook, Google and other technology companies receive hundreds of thousands of orders from law enforcement agencies seeking data people stash online: private messages, photos, search histories, calendar items &mdash; a potentially rich trove for criminal investigators. Often, those requests are accompanied by secrecy orders, also known as nondisclosure or gag orders, that require the tech companies to keep their customers in the dark, potentially for years.</p></div><div><p>Concern about the practice spiked this summer after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-justice-dept-seized-post-reporters-phone-records/2021/05/07/933cdfc6-af5b-11eb-b476-c3b287e52a01_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalists at The Washington Post and the New York Times</a> learned that the Trump Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed their email account data in an effort to identify the source of classified leaks early in President Donald Trump&rsquo;s term. Federal prosecutors also targeted Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, their aides and even family members.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>But those requests were just a tiny fraction of the orders prosecutors secure annually to stealthily snoop through the data of ordinary users like Lackey.</p></div><div><p>In the last six months of 2020, Facebook received 61,262 government requests for user data in the United States, said spokesman Andy Stone. Most &mdash; 69 percent &mdash; came with secrecy orders. Meanwhile, Microsoft has received between 2,400 and 3,500 secrecy orders from federal law enforcement each year since 2016 &mdash; or seven to 10 per day &mdash; according to congressional testimony by vice president of customer security and trust Tom Burt.</p></div><div><p>Google and Apple declined to disclose the number of gag orders they&rsquo;ve received. But in the first half of 2020, Google said U.S. law enforcement made 39,536 requests for information about 84,662 accounts &mdash; with many of the requests targeting multiple accounts. Apple said it received 11,363 requests.</p></div><div><p>The Trump administration is hardly the first to use gag orders for tech-company searches. Under the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, federal prosecutors are required to seek digital information from tech companies, not their customers. Since then, prosecutors have routinely used gag orders to prevent the companies from spilling the beans to suspects who might destroy evidence, go into hiding or threaten someone&rsquo;s life.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>But the practice has mushroomed over the past two decades, part of a broader surveillance ramp-up following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, lawyers said. As the orders have proliferated, privacy advocates and the tech companies themselves have become increasingly concerned.</p></div><div><div><div><figure><figcaption>An investigation by a consortium of media organizations has found that military-grade spyware licensed by an Israeli firm has been used to hack smartphones. (Jon Gerberg/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>Some tech company officials have accused prosecutors of reflexively requesting gag orders for routine investigations, regardless of whether the cases actually require such secrecy. And an array of company officials and legal experts argue that the practice robs tech company customers of their constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;Across all the rest of society, it&rsquo;s understood that government doesn&rsquo;t get to take your stuff, doesn&rsquo;t get to come in and into your house, doesn&rsquo;t get to break into your file folders or your lock box at the bank without a warrant. And you get to know about that warrant and you get to exercise your legal rights,&rdquo; Microsoft&rsquo;s Burt said in an interview.<b> </b>&ldquo;Someone cannot exercise their Fourth Amendment rights when their data has been taken in secret.&rdquo;</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>With lawmakers in both parties considering reining in the practice, the Justice Department is reviewing its policies regarding nondisclosure orders that delay notification of tech company customers, said spokesman Joshua Stueve.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The Department is committed to properly balancing legitimate needs for confidentiality in criminal investigations with the public&rsquo;s interest in understanding how investigative authorities are used,&rdquo; Stueve said in an email, though he declined to specify what changes are under consideration.</p></div><div><p>The proliferation of gag orders mirrors the explosion of electronic evidence as the world has become more digital, said Ed Kim, a former prosecutor in the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York, who is in private practice in New York now.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s led tech companies to get more vigilant,&rdquo; Kim said.</p></div><div><p>When prosecutors obtain warrants for physical evidence, they rarely need a gag order. That&rsquo;s because the person who owns the objects &mdash; a weapon used in a crime, for example, or a box of documents &mdash; is often present when the evidence is seized. And if the evidence is seized improperly, either because the dragnet is overly broad or because of outright investigative abuses, the target of the search typically has an opportunity to challenge it in court.</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s different with digital evidence, which is often kept on the servers of tech companies. That evidence can include highly sensitive details about a person&rsquo;s entire life, including photos, text messages and phone records that could be used to establish their relationships, describe their motives or even place them at the scene of a crime.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>But when investigators serve tech companies with subpoenas or search warrants for this information, the target of the investigation has no idea their data is being seized. And if investigators obtain a gag order, the records must be handed over without the person&rsquo;s knowledge or consent &mdash; depriving the person of an opportunity to challenge the seizure in court.</p></div><div><p>Justice Department officials argue there are legitimate reasons to request secrecy orders, especially during complex investigations targeting drug dealers or crime bosses. They note that secrecy orders require judicial approval, providing a check on their investigative powers.</p></div><div><p>But the bar is often low for investigators to prove the need for secrecy, said white-collar defense lawyer Robert Mintz, a former deputy chief of the Organized Crime Strike Force Division of the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>&ldquo;Judges are in a difficult position of having to gauge the necessity of having subpoenas being secret at the beginning of an investigation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Historically, judges have given great deference to prosecutors.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Over the years, tech companies such as Google have increasingly tried to challenge gag orders that appear to be unnecessary, said Albert Gidari, a former lawyer for Big Tech and telecommunications firms who later served as director of privacy at Stanford Law School&rsquo;s Center for Internet and Society. Where possible, he said, they also have sought to alert users to the search warrants and share details in so-called &ldquo;transparency reports.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>But tech company officials said it is often difficult to tell which orders are worth fighting. The orders are often vague &mdash; sometimes just<b> </b>email addresses &mdash; and the owner of the account isn&rsquo;t always obvious.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Microsoft provided two secrecy orders to The Post with the names of the customers redacted. Each is only about four paragraphs long and declares that notifying the customer about the existence of the data request could lead to evidence tampering or flight from prosecution.</p></div><div><p>Neither order offers any support for those claims, or any details to indicate why secrecy is necessary. Microsoft complied with both orders and notified customers of the seizure only after the orders expired.</p></div><div><p>Microsoft said it generally complies with secrecy orders because it is legally required to do so. At Google, director of law enforcement and information security Richard Salgado said the company will challenge nondisclosure orders if there are &ldquo;external signals&rdquo; that the orders lack merit. For example, email addresses can indicate who the subjects or their employers are, providing an avenue for the company to argue against secrecy, said Salgado, a former federal prosecutor.</p></div><div><div><div aria-hidden="true"><div><p>Story continues below advertisement</p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Google&rsquo;s decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/us/politics/times-reporter-emails-gag-order-trump-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenge the gag order</a> on the Trump Justice Department&rsquo;s subpoena for email data belonging to four reporters at the New York Times, which uses Google&rsquo;s mail service, offers a rare example of such a challenge becoming public. Google won, and was able to share details of the subpoena &mdash; initially only with a Times lawyer.</p></div><div><p>Often, however, the orders &ldquo;are rather generic,&rdquo; Salgado said, providing too little information for Google to mount a case.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;These nondisclosure orders are issued more routinely than makes sense,&rdquo; he said.</p></div><div><p>Consider the case of Lackey. A former Defense Department contractor, Lackey now runs a security consulting business that has handled matters involving cryptocurrency and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/12/ransomware-attack/?itid=lk_inline_manual_56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ransomware</a>. Lackey acknowledges that work could conceivably place him in the crosshairs of law enforcement.</p></div><div><p>But Lackey says it&rsquo;s not at all clear why prosecutors would sift through his data on Facebook, where he oversees several groups, including one focused on cat photos.</p></div><div><p>Was the FBI after basic subscriber information, such as his name and when he created the account? Or did they seize something much more problematic, such as personal photos, private messages or a history of his movements at home and abroad during 15 years of logging into the app? The latter, he said, would be a &ldquo;severe violation of my expectation of my privacy.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>It&rsquo;s unclear even when the secrecy order was first issued, though Lackey said clues from legal documents he has since obtained suggest that he was kept in the dark for at least two years before Facebook sent him that March email.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty confident that I&rsquo;m a fairly boring person. I haven&rsquo;t done anything that I would consider worthy of the FBI&rsquo;s time or interest,&rdquo; Lackey said.</p></div><div><p>Stueve, the Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment on Lackey&rsquo;s case, as did Stone, the Facebook spokesman. Stone pointed to Facebook&rsquo;s transparency report, which notes that it complies with government requests for user information when required by law and that it turns over data &ldquo;narrowly tailored&rdquo; to each request.</p></div><div><p>In an emailed statement, Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel Chris Sonderby said Facebook officials &ldquo;push back against government overreach and challenge nondisclosure orders in court when necessary.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Our policy is to notify people who use our platform of requests for their information unless prohibited by law or in exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>After receiving the March email, Lackey asked Facebook what information it had handed over and what time frame the request covered. In an emailed response reviewed by The Post, the tech giant wrote that it couldn&rsquo;t give him &ldquo;legal advice&rdquo; and suggested that he &ldquo;consult with an attorney.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>Lackey said he has been left with &ldquo;low-level anxiety&rdquo; and lots of unanswered questions.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not opposed to helping law enforcement with a legitimate investigation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s a civil liberties violation or a fishing expedition, I don&rsquo;t want to help them in that.&rdquo;</p></div><div><p>As privacy advocates and tech company officials press prosecutors for more transparency, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are beginning to sift through their options for reining in the practice. One idea: Require tech companies to preserve digital files that are the subject of court orders and permit customers to challenge the orders in court before the information is turned over to prosecutors.</p></div><div><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is drafting a measure that would require government investigators to tell the targets of surveillance what data they gather from the tech companies within a reasonable time, much as they already do for more traditional wiretaps and bank-record subpoenas. The measure would cover demands for location records, stored emails, social media photos and other data, said a Wyden aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal bill-writing process.</p></div><div><p>The measure also would require federal courts to publish, for the first time, basic statistics about surveillance and secrecy orders. But it would continue to permit the orders to be issued.</p></div><div><p>Wyden is hoping the measure will attract bipartisan support. While Democrats have expressed outrage over the Trump administration&rsquo;s leak investigation, Republicans have accused President Biden and former president Barack Obama of snooping on conservatives.</p></div><div><p>&ldquo;The United States of America should not spy on its citizens,&rdquo; Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said during a June hearing on the issue. &ldquo;This process is in need of reform.&rdquo;</p></div></section></div>]]></content>

	<title type="html">Other than Prison, Electronic Monitoring is 'the Most Restrictive Form' of Control, Research Finds</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An anonymous reader shares a report: In the past 18 months, as the judicial system has increasingly ...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An anonymous reader shares a report: In the past 18 months, as the judicial system has increasingly used electronic monitoring instead of prisons to monitor inmates through the coronavirus pandemic, newly released data confirm what activists and advocates have long argued: Ankle monitors are onerous, and they often subject wearers to vague rules, like avoiding people of "disreputable character." The ankle monitoring business, the research found, is also dominated by four profit-seeking companies, and it ultimately could drive more people back to prison. 

The new, comprehensive collection of hundreds of electronic monitoring-related rules, policies and contracts, obtained through public records requests across 44 states, demonstrates that four companies that make millions of dollars a year account for 64 percent of the contracts examined in the study. The companies -- Attenti, BI Inc., Satellite Tracking of People and Sentinel Offender Services LLC, according to the report -- also keep location data indefinitely, even after monitoring is completed, which is within the law. Governments also often require family members or employers to act as agents of the government and report potential violations, putting them in an awkward position in which they must be both supportive and supervisory. 

Crucially, wearers must pay both one-time and ongoing fees for the monitors, which can be $25 to over $8,000 a year. The report argues that such costs "undermine financial security when it is needed most." By comparison, the Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons said in 2018 that it costs just under $100 per day to incarcerate a federal inmate, or over $36,000 a year. Put another way, wearers in Los Angeles and Sacramento counties in California, which impose the highest annual costs, according to the new findings, pay $22 a day -- still considerably less than what taxpayers would otherwise pay.</p><p></p><div>

<span>  Introducing our groundbreaking report on the Maryland correctional food system&mdash;the first-of-its-kind investigation into prison food from an abolitionist perspective. </span></p>


<p><span> On September 9, 2021, the 50th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising, we are honored to release our grassroots capstone report on the experience of eating in Maryland's prisons. A culmination of over two years of research, conversations, interviews, and dialogue circles with folks formerly and currently imprisoned in Maryland, this report uncovers the violence of the Maryland correctional food system&mdash;laying bare the true impact of food in confinement.<p>
From insects, maggots, and rat droppings in meal trays; to food that is routinely described as &ldquo;unfit for animals, much less human beings&rdquo;; to the manufacturing of perpetual hunger as a source of financial extraction for commissary providers; the people we spoke with characterized prison food provision as nothing short of a public health and human rights crisis. Our findings span over 180 pages and are divided into six sections&mdash;each describing a different aspect of the carceral industrial food system. Crucially, this report brings to light both the central role of food inside prison as well as its implications outside of bondage for those working toward food sovereignty and, more broadly, communal self-determination. 
</p><p> We are releasing each part of our report separately over the span of two weeks. As of September 22, 2021, all parts have been made public. </p></span></p>
</div></div><div><div><p>
<span>  Access and ownership over the food we eat is one of our most basic rights.
The creation of a world where we all have power over food that physically,
spiritually, and emotionally sustains us, heals us, and nourishes us cannot
exist while prisons and all structures of violence oppression still stand. <p>It is
from this grounding that we present this report. </p></span></p>
